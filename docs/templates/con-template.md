## Context

Brief description of the architectural slot or conceptual requirement this ADR defines, and why vendor-agnostic requirements are needed.

## Problem Statement

**Core Need**: [What architectural capability or service is required]

**Constraints**: [Technical, operational, or business constraints that shape requirements]

**Context**: [How this fits into the broader system architecture]

## Requirements Definition

### Functional Requirements
1. **[Requirement 1]**: [Detailed description of what the system must do]
2. **[Requirement 2]**: [Additional functional capability needed]
3. **[Requirement 3]**: [Supporting functional requirements]

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: [Latency, throughput, or scaling requirements]
2. **Reliability**: [Availability, durability, fault tolerance needs]
3. **Security**: [Authentication, authorization, encryption requirements]
4. **Operability**: [Monitoring, deployment, maintenance needs]
5. **Compatibility**: [Integration, platform, or ecosystem requirements]

### Quality Attributes
- **Scalability**: [How the solution should scale with load/data]
- **Maintainability**: [Requirements for ongoing maintenance and updates]
- **Extensibility**: [How the solution should accommodate future changes]
- **Portability**: [Cross-platform or migration requirements]

## Architectural Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- [Programming language or framework limitations]
- [Infrastructure or deployment constraints]
- [Integration requirements with existing systems]

### Business Constraints
- [Budget or resource limitations]
- [Timeline requirements]
- [Compliance or regulatory requirements]

### Operational Constraints
- [Team skill requirements]
- [Operational complexity limitations]
- [Support and maintenance capabilities]

## Success Criteria

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **[Criteria 1]**: [Measurable success condition]
2. **[Criteria 2]**: [Additional acceptance requirement]
3. **[Criteria 3]**: [Supporting success measure]

### Performance Benchmarks
- **[Metric 1]**: [Target value and measurement method]
- **[Metric 2]**: [Additional performance target]

## Implementation Guidance

### Vendor Selection Criteria
1. **[Criteria 1]**: [What implementations should prioritize]
2. **[Criteria 2]**: [Additional selection considerations]
3. **[Criteria 3]**: [Supporting evaluation factors]

### Integration Patterns
- [How implementations should integrate with existing architecture]
- [Required interfaces or protocols]
- [Data flow and communication patterns]

### Deployment Considerations
- [Environmental requirements]
- [Scaling and resource allocation guidance]
- [Operational monitoring and alerting needs]

## Related Decisions

**Research Basis:**
- [RSH-XXX]: [Research that informed these requirements]

**Implementations:**
- [VEN-XXX]: [Vendor selection that implements this concept]

**Dependencies:**
- [CON-XXX]: [Other conceptual requirements this depends on]

## Evolution Path

### Anticipated Changes
- [How requirements might evolve over time]
- [Factors that could drive requirement changes]

### Migration Strategy
- [How to transition between implementations]
- [Backward compatibility considerations]

## Reevaluation Triggers

- [Business requirement changes that would affect this concept]
- [Technical constraint changes that would require review]
- [Performance threshold breaches that would trigger reconsideration]
