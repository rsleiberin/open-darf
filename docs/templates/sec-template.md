## Context

Brief description of the security challenge being addressed and why a specific security approach is needed for the system's protection and compliance requirements.

## Security Requirements

**Primary Threats**: [Key security threats this decision addresses]

**Compliance Needs**: [Regulatory or compliance requirements driving this decision]

**Risk Tolerance**: [Acceptable risk levels and security/usability tradeoffs]

## Security Architecture

### Threat Model
1. **[Threat 1]**: [Description of threat actor, attack vector, and potential impact]
2. **[Threat 2]**: [Additional threat scenario and risk assessment]
3. **[Threat 3]**: [Supporting threat consideration]

### Security Controls
- **Preventive Controls**: [Measures that prevent security incidents]
- **Detective Controls**: [Measures that identify security incidents]
- **Corrective Controls**: [Measures that respond to and recover from incidents]

### Defense in Depth Strategy
- **[Layer 1]**: [Perimeter/network security measures]
- **[Layer 2]**: [Application/service security measures]
- **[Layer 3]**: [Data/content security measures]
- **[Layer 4]**: [Identity/access security measures]

## Implementation Strategy

### Authentication Architecture

- **Permission Management**: [How permissions are assigned and managed]
- **Privilege Escalation**: [How elevated access is controlled]

### Data Protection
- **Encryption Strategy**: [Data at rest, in transit, and in use protection]
- **Key Management**: [Cryptographic key lifecycle and protection]
- **Data Classification**: [How data sensitivity is categorized and protected]

### Security Monitoring

- **Anomaly Detection**: [How unusual activity is identified]
- **Incident Response**: [How security incidents are handled]

## Compliance Framework

### Regulatory Requirements
- **[Regulation 1]**: [Specific compliance requirement and implementation]
- **[Regulation 2]**: [Additional regulatory consideration]

### Audit and Documentation
