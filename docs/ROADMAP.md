## Executive Overview

DARF has achieved substantial technical advancement through the completion of constitutional constraint engine infrastructure and comprehensive administrative consolidation. The project now focuses on systematic Phase-2 integration to establish operational constitutional constraint validation across the document processing pipeline. The near-term objective is completing constitutional engine integration while maintaining established performance characteristics and advancing toward comprehensive document processing capabilities with provably aligned constitutional constraints, comprehensive observability through receipts and metrics, and performant operations with ninety-fifth percentile response times below fifty milliseconds for hot paths.

This roadmap reflects current project status following Milestone-1 completion and administrative consolidation, providing concrete deliverables with established performance gates and comprehensive audit trail requirements.

## Current Project Status and Phasing

**Phase 1 – Ingestion Foundations: COMPLETED**
Phase 1 infrastructure development has been completed with validated performance characteristics. Deterministic SHA-256 anchoring implementation provides document and paragraph sub-anchor capabilities. Provenance graph initialization using W3C PROV-O standards establishes comprehensive Entity, Activity, and Agent tracking. Routing logic with Lambda versus EC2 decision capability and MinIO contract implementation support scalable document processing workflows. Unit testing coverage, performance validation, and receipt generation frameworks provide robust development foundation.

**Phase 2 – Constitutional Engine Integration: IN PROGRESS**
Constitutional engine core infrastructure has been completed through PR #271 with tri-state evaluation capabilities, DENY precedence logic, and fail-closed security posture. Four critical integration tasks have been elevated to high priority status requiring systematic completion for operational constitutional constraint validation. These integration requirements address DENY precedence integration with live database operations, tri-state decision framework implementation across system components, fail-closed production posture establishment, and scope-based authorization framework development.

**Phase 3 – Bias Filteration and Document Processing: PLANNED**
Following constitutional engine integration completion, document processing capabilities will be developed with bias detection via Contextualized Bi-Directional Dual Transformer implementation for technical and academic corpora. Lightweight named entity recognition and relationship extraction capabilities will support language-agnostic processing where feasible. Constitutional constraint validation will be integrated throughout document processing workflows.

**Phase 4 – HybridRAG and Knowledge Graph Integration: PLANNED**
Hierarchical chunking with vector and graph retrieval orchestration will provide comprehensive knowledge management capabilities. Constitutional validation will be integrated into retrieval and synthesis operations ensuring sovereignty preservation throughout knowledge graph interactions.

**Phase 5 – Observability and Service Level Objective Optimization: PLANNED**
Comprehensive observability framework with ninety-fifth percentile latency monitoring, compression target validation, receipt coverage analysis, and operational dashboard implementation will provide production-ready monitoring capabilities. Rotating receipt management with correlation identifiers and latency field tracking will support regulatory compliance and operational transparency requirements.

## Performance Targets and Quality Gates

**Established Performance Thresholds:**
Vector search operations maintain ninety-fifth percentile performance below ten milliseconds. Graph query operations achieve ninety-fifth percentile response times below fifty milliseconds. Constitutional constraint validation operates at sub-170 milliseconds ninety-fifth percentile with demonstrated average response times of 49.75 milliseconds providing substantial performance margin. Bias detection capabilities target F1 scores above 0.91 with maximum latency of two seconds. Provenance overhead remains below four percent maximum impact on system performance.

**Quality Assurance Requirements:**
Compression capabilities target forty-seven times semantic and contextual compression through hierarchical chunking implementation. Recall improvement targets sixty percent enhancement in relevant context recall through HyperGraphRAG implementation. All performance-sensitive changes require append-only receipt generation under documented audit directories. Constitutional constraint validation maintains fail-closed security posture with comprehensive testing coverage.

## Phase 2 Integration Priorities

**Issue #240: DENY Precedence Integration**
Integration of validated DENY precedence logic with Neo4j constitutional graph database operations requires systematic connection between graph traversal results and precedence resolution functions. Implementation must maintain forty-nine point seven-five millisecond average response time performance while providing comprehensive constitutional decision audit trails. Testing coverage must address end-to-end validation scenarios exercising DENY precedence across varied constitutional constraint configurations.

**Issue #241: Tri-State Decision Framework Integration**
Systematic implementation of ALLOW, DENY, and INDETERMINATE decision states across all system components requires comprehensive integration throughout the validation pipeline. ValidationResult structures must capture decision rationale and performance metrics while maintaining compatibility with existing infrastructure components. Integration testing must verify tri-state decision propagation maintains constitutional compliance under various operational conditions including database connectivity failures and incomplete constitutional graph data.

**Issue #242: Fail-Closed Production Posture Implementation**
Production deployment requires systematic implementation of fail-closed security posture defaulting to INDETERMINATE responses when constitutional validation cannot be completed reliably. Technical implementation involves disabling ENGINE_FAIL_OPEN override capabilities in production environments and implementing systematic fallback logic generating appropriate responses during constitutional graph query failures or timeout conditions. Comprehensive monitoring for fail-closed activation scenarios must support operational awareness and system optimization while maintaining clear communication about constitutional validation limitations.

**Issue #243: Scope-Based Authorization Framework Development**
Advanced constitutional constraint validation requires scope-based authorization enabling granular control over constitutional decision authority based on principal identity, action classification, and contextual factors. Implementation specifications include designing scope taxonomy capturing relevant constitutional authority dimensions and integrating scope validation into constitutional graph queries ensuring appropriate authorization checking. Performance optimization must maintain sub-millisecond impact on hot-path operations while supporting comprehensive audit logging for scope-based authorization decisions.
