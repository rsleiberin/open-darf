# Phase 7E — Implementation Closeout (Impl → Architect)

**Date (UTC):** 2025-09-05

## 1) Outcomes
- PR #356 merged (conflicts resolved by regenerating evidence pack on PR head; promptless squash-merge).
- PR #358 merged (docs-only reindex; evidence pack & index now consistent).
- CI snapshots captured and summarized for "CI Gates" and "Phase 7E Tests".
- Performance receipt generated for deterministic ExplanationEngine overhead.
- Grant-ready demonstration package prepared (archive + docs verification + demo runs).

## 2) Artifacts (local repository paths)
- Grant archive: var/receipts/phase7e/grant_demo/20250905-020131/grant_ready_package.tgz
- Demo runs: var/receipts/phase7e/grant_demo/20250905-020131/demo
- Performance summary: var/receipts/phase7e/grant_demo/20250905-020131/perf_summary.md
- Doc verification summary: var/receipts/phase7e/grant_demo/20250905-020131/doc_verification/summary.md
- CI snapshot summary: var/receipts/phase7e/closeout/20250905-013547/snapshot_summary.txt
- Perf raw receipt: var/receipts/phase7e/closeout/20250905-015338/perf/reasoning_overhead.json

## 3) Key metrics
- ExplanationEngine p50 (ns): 2875
- ExplanationEngine p95 (ns): 5540
- Evidence pack consistency: files=index=pack (true)
- CI status on main: COMPLETED / SUCCESS (per latest snapshot)

## 4) Provenance & receipts
- Receipts under var/receipts/phase7e/* (untracked, except Phase 6C allowlisted).
- Merge receipts for PR #356 and #358 present with logs and SHA pins.

## 5) Follow-ups / hygiene
- All feature branches merged/pruned; main is clean.
- A prior auto-stash was restored to a separate WIP branch for human review (contains local test/tool changes); see “WIP branch” below.

## 6) Decisions honored
- DENY precedence enforced in reasoning scenarios.
- No unsupported fields in GH CLI snapshots; duration derived from timestamps.
- Generated artifacts under docs/ committed; receipts/emissions remain untracked.
