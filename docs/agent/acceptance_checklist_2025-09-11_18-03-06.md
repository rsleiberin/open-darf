# Phase 7N — Acceptance Checklist (Final Snapshot)

## Technical Milestones
- [x] **Docker GPU visibility validated** (`nvidia-smi` in CUDA base)
- [x] **Mini validation via PT control image attempted** (Torch CUDA still unavailable under WSL containers)
- [ ] **Full PURE inference ≥ 0.30 F1** (blocked pending runtime decision)
- [ ] **Open-darf one-line demo end-to-end** (blocked pending runtime decision)

## Grant Timeline Compliance
- [x] Blocker documented with pivot options for architect
- [ ] Community validation package (post-runtime pivot)
- [ ] Automatic metrics generation (post-PURE run)

## Process Excellence
- [x] **GO-gate respected** (no long runs)
- [x] **Cache discipline** (no rebuilds; short pulls only)
- [x] **Clear escalation** (decision records written)
