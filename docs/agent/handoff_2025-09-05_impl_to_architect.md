# Implementation Handoff — Phase 7E → Architect (2025-09-05)

## What changed in 7E (since 7D)
- **CI Gates unblocked & stabilized** via tracked Phase-6C validation receipts.
  - PR #352 (allowlist placeholders) → merged.
  - PR #353 (schema-shaped receipts) → merged.
- **Operator workflow**:
  - Schema + validator + quickstart + dependency/interaction analysis note.
  - Deterministic tri-state with **DENY precedence**; ALLOW mass threshold documented.
- **Evidence**:
  - Redacted enriched exemplars added.
  - Consolidated pack generator and pack `{md,json}` produced.
- **CI**:
  - New `Phase 7E Tests` workflow runs `tests/phase7e` (green on main).
  - CI Gates also green on main with shaped receipts.

## Guarantees & invariants preserved
- **Fail-closed default** (unknown ⇒ PENDING).
- **Strict DENY precedence** (weights cannot override).
- **Enrichment invariance** (no change to base decisions).

## Artifacts
- Evidence pack: `docs/evidence/phase7e/pack.{md,json}`
- Operator schema/validator: `tools/constitutional/reasoning/{operator_vote_schema.json, validate_votes.py}`
- 7E CI: `.github/workflows/phase7e.yml`
- PROV: `docs/audit/provenance/phase7e_provenance.jsonld`

## Open decisions requested (carry-over)
1. **BioRED gold schema & paths** (Phase 7B acceptance): Option A vs B; finalize dev/test artifact paths.
2. **Operator workflow input format** final minimal JSON/YAML and redaction policy (currently draft finalized for 7E).
3. **E2E scope**: select 2–3 pipelines to run under `REASONING_ENABLE=1` and contribute redacted enriched audits to evidence.

## Next steps proposal (no gating risk)
- Run 2 E2E scenarios (see `docs/e2e/scenarios.md`) and add 3–5 more enriched exemplars.
- Append **benchmarks vs training-based alignment** once acceptance datasets are confirmed.

*No `.tla/.cfg` files modified. All changes are additive and feature-flagged.*
