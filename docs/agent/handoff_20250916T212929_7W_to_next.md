# Phase 7W — Implementation Agent Handoff

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-16T21:29:29-05:00

## Completed
- A1: Container stack scaffolded; HUD probes stabilized with functional checks.
- A2: Constitutional engine v4 with JSON-safe Postgres receipts; Neo4j constraints seeded.
- A3: Dataset registry scaffolding & receipts; MinIO/Qdrant quick probes.
- Safe Mode Guard: peer-friendly RAM/SWAP gate, non-blocking probes, hardened timeout helpers.
- Fixed peer-safe receipt writer to avoid "DO 1916" crash; idempotent schema ensure.

## Known Notes
- Qdrant container health may show "unhealthy" while functional — functional probe supersedes healthcheck.
- MinIO readiness endpoint can be flaky; flows avoid blocking and cap sidecar helpers.

## Next Steps
- Wire dataset loaders to evidence pipeline with ionice/nice wrappers.
- Expand rule evaluation beyond R0; persist denormalized decision views.

## Provenance
- Branch: main → main (squash-merged locally)
- Commit: 1f81c21
- Receipts table: audit.receipts (latest rows from safe-mode guard & dataset probes)
