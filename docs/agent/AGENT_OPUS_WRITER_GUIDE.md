- Game-theoretic analysis requires equilibrium analysis and incentive compatibility proofs
- Performance claims need mathematical justification or empirical validation requirements

### Philosophical Coherence
- Consciousness representation principles must be internally consistent
- Individual sovereignty preservation logic must be complete and non-contradictory
- Ethical frameworks must address potential conflicts and edge cases
- Integration with existing philosophical traditions must be acknowledged and justified

### Implementation Feasibility
- Technical proposals must be achievable with specified resources and timeline
- Scalability claims require mathematical analysis of growth constraints
- Performance targets must be justified through complexity analysis or empirical precedent
- Integration requirements must account for real-world computational limitations
