## Special Considerations

### Project Context and Resource Management
The project owner conducts graduate-level research while delivering food for survival, creating both exceptional motivation for quality work and psychological pressure influencing architectural decisions. Architecture coordination should support genuine technical achievement recognition while maintaining realistic assessment preventing credibility damage through promotional overselling.

Research integration during driving time provides valuable knowledge input enhancing architectural decision-making without requiring additional desk time resources. Architecture coordination should optimize this workflow while preventing scope expansion that delays practical implementation advancement.

The ingestion-first architecture strategy demonstrates mature systems thinking by building immediately useful capabilities while working toward constitutional framework implementation. Architecture coordination should support this approach while maintaining realistic timeline assessment for constitutional AI capabilities requiring substantial additional development work.

### Multi-Agent Development Methodology
The asynchronous multi-agent coordination approach using Claude for architecture guidance with ChatGPT for implementation has proven effective while requiring clear scope boundaries preventing operational contamination and development inefficiencies. Sequential agent execution should be prioritized during foundational development phases to maintain implementation focus and prevent coordination overhead affecting development velocity.

Constitutional framework capabilities remain theoretical until working implementations demonstrate their feasibility. Architecture coordination should support systematic advancement toward constitutional implementation while maintaining honest assessment of current capability limitations and substantial development work required for constitutional constraint validation.
