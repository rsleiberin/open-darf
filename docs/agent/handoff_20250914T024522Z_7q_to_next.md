# Handoff — Phase 7Q → Next Implementation Agent

**Timestamp (UTC):** 20250914T024522Z
**From Agent:** 7Q (Implementation)
**Repo:** `darf-source`
**Branch:** `phase7q/wsl-cuda-pivot`
**Tag (to be created):** `phase7q_checkpoint_20250914T024522Z`

---

## 1. What Changed in 7Q
- Introduced verbose, timestamped setup/probe harness with explicit BEGIN/END and per-step RC.
- Captured deterministic failure signature for PyTorch on WSL2: `cudaGetDeviceCount -> Error 500: named symbol not found` under CUDA 12.1 and 12.6.2.
- Validated single-provider `libcuda` enforcement and mounted DX12/ML components; failure persists.
- Installed cu126 Torch stack inside `nvidia/cuda:12.6.2-runtime-ubuntu22.04` with success on deps visibility but failure on Torch CUDA availability.

## 2. Artifacts
- Receipts: `var/receipts/phase7q/` (this session and prior runs).
- Decision record: `docs/decisions/phase_7q_strategic_pivot.md`.
- Context snapshots: `/home/tank/darf-source/var/receipts/phase7q/20250914T024522Z_repo_sync` (docker info, git status, etc.).

## 3. Current Status
- **Docker GPU smoke:** PASS (GPU visible)  
- **Torch CUDA availability:** FAIL (Error 500)  
- **WSL2 path:** Documented as non-viable on critical path.

## 4. Next Steps (Recommended)
1. Native Linux validation path:
   - Ubuntu 22.04+, latest stable NVIDIA driver.
   - Docker + nvidia-container-toolkit.
   - Torch cu126 wheels inside CUDA 12.6 runtime; assert `torch.cuda.is_available() == True`.
2. If native passes, proceed to validator demo workloads and performance receipts.
3. Keep WSL2 notes for post-demo investigation only.

## 5. Risks & Deadlines
- **Grant Deadline:** Oct 1, 2025.
- **Risk:** Persisting with WSL2 may consume remaining time; pivot mitigates.

**Status:** Branch prepared for handoff; tag to be created and pushed.
