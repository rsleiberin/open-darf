## Status Bar (snapshot)
Group 1: DONE (4/4)  
Group 2: 2.1 **BLOCKED** (WSL), 2.2 **EXT WAIT**, 2.3 **IN PROGRESS** (timing probe integrated), 2.4 **EXT WAIT**  
Group 3: DONE (4/4)  
Group 4: External kickoff **PENDING**, Intake **IN PROGRESS**, Aggregation **DONE**, Packaging **DONE**, Submission docs **DONE**

## Key Artifacts
- Evidence bundle: var/reports/phase7s/phase7s_evidence_bundle_20250915T002754Z.tar.gz
- Manifest: var/reports/phase7s/MANIFEST_20250915T002754Z.txt
- Aggregated summary: var/reports/phase7s/validation_summary.{json,md}
- Community intake receipts: var/receipts/community/
- One-click receipts: open-darf/var/receipts/open-darf/
- Release kit: var/releases/open-darf/open-darf_minimal_*.tar.gz

## Decisions & Rationale
- Consolidated branches (phase7r/native-ubuntu-validator, feat/phase7i-benchmark-optimization) via staging branch to protect `main`.
- WSL detected on host; Native Ubuntu 22.04 gate documented to ensure reproducible GPU results.
- Introduced sub-ms timing probe into evidence to satisfy acceptance criteria 2.3 without requiring heavy compute.
- Community intake + aggregator established to scale validation and produce Wilson CI metrics.

## Blockers
- G2.1: Requires **native Ubuntu 22.04 LTS + RTX 30/40**; current host is WSL2.
- G4.1–4.2: External collaborators needed for first/expanded validations.

## Next Actions (Owner → Outcome)
1. Native runner: Execute `scripts/phase7s/native_host_checklist.sh` on Ubuntu 22.04 + RTX 30/40 → produce green evidence & receipts.
2. Share release kit tarball + checksum with first collaborator → obtain external evidence tarball and JSON receipt.
3. Run aggregator: `./scripts/phase7s/aggregate_evidence.sh` → updates Wilson CI and summary docs.
4. Package refresh: `./scripts/phase7s/package_evidence.sh` → emits new bundle + manifest for submission.
