- Orchestrator run_all and aggregation
- Acceptance checker and CI workflow
- Dataset bootstrapper, split verifier, preflight gate
- Competitive comparison scaffold and PR closeout checklist

Current state
- Receipts (count): 46
- Acceptance overall: FAIL
- Best SciERC test F1_micro (so far): 0
- Runs evaluated: 10

Next actions (exact commands)
1. Populate dataset sources if needed
   make bootstrap verify-splits
2. Configure runner commands
   edit scripts/phase7i/runner_cmds.env
   set RUNNER_PURE_CMD and RUNNER_PLMARKER_CMD to absolute commands
3. Execute baselines
   make bench-all
4. Aggregate and check acceptance
   make aggregate
   make accept
5. Optional filters pass
   scripts/phase7i/run_all.sh --split=test --filters=directionality,negation,type
6. Update competitive comparison
   edit docs/scoreboards/phase7i/literature_baselines.json
   scripts/phase7i/compare_against_baselines.py
7. Closeout
   ensure acceptance PASS
   update docs/phase7i/PR_CLOSEOUT_CHECKLIST.md
