# DARF Ingestion System: Automation Progression Map

## Your Automation Goal: ANR-Driven Document Intelligence

**End State Vision**: ANRs automatically ingest documents, extract constitutional constraints, dedupe content, formalize ideas, and create test anchors - transforming your document chaos into a self-organizing knowledge system.

- ✅ **Learning Pipeline**: Processing quality automatically improves from document pattern analysis
- ✅ **Constitutional Evolution**: Democratic principles automatically refine through community feedback
- ✅ **Decision Suggestions**: System automatically proposes architectural decisions from document insights

## Current Priority: Level 1 Foundation Intelligence

### Immediate Automation Opportunities

**Evidence Envelope Implementation**:
Your `docs/reference/` corpus becomes the perfect test case. Each PDF and markdown file gets automatic:
- SHA-256 content fingerprinting for immutable reference
- Metadata extraction (author, creation date, document type)
- Format-specific parsing (PDF text extraction, markdown structure preservation)
- MinIO storage with content-addressable keys

**Document Cleanup Automation**:
The system automatically identifies and handles:
- Duplicate content across different formats (PDF vs MD of same content)
- Obsolete documents that reference superseded architectural decisions
- Fragmented information that should be consolidated into single ANRs

**Constitutional Content Detection**:
Even at Level 1, the system begins identifying:
- Architectural principles that function as constitutional constraints
- Decision precedents that establish governance patterns
- Research findings that support or challenge existing constitutional assumptions

## Your Document Corpus: Perfect Automation Test Case

**Architecture Documents**: Transform into ANRs preserving constitutional constraint relationships  
**Research Papers**: Extract constitutional principles and precedent relationships  
**System Designs**: Formalize architectural decisions with democratic validation  
**Duplicate Content**: Automatically identify and consolidate scattered information

**Automation Progression Visible**: Each document processed shows measurable improvement in:
- Reduced manual metadata entry
- Increased constitutional principle extraction
- Better relationship discovery between related documents
- Higher quality test anchor generation
