=== RESEARCH FOUNDATION ===

Primary Research Document: Janus Backend Architecture – Onboarding Brief
- 26 pages of comprehensive architectural analysis
- Research basis for 9 core vendor selections
- Alternatives analysis for each major component

Secondary Research Documents:
- Best Vector Database Options for a Python-Based AI Stack
- Building a Universal, ACID-Compliant Backend Tech Stack
- Redis vs RabbitMQ as Dramatiq Brokers comparison
- Evaluating RAG Retriever Layer Options for Qdrant and Neo4j

=== ENHANCED METADATA TRACKING ===

All ADRs now include:
- Decision confidence scores (1-10 scale)
- Time investment tracking (actual hours spent)
- Main tradeoffs explicitly documented
- Alternatives rejected with rationale
- Specific reevaluation triggers
- Research basis citations
- Evidence linking to source documents

=== AUTOMATION TOOLING ===

Created 27 automation tools for ADR management:
- Migration and validation scripts
- Type system enforcement
- YAML syntax validation
- Cross-reference maintenance
- Research-to-ADR ingestion pipeline ready

=== SYSTEM READINESS ===

✅ All ADRs migrated to enhanced format
✅ Type system fully implemented
✅ Research traceability established
✅ Validation pipeline functional
✅ Ready for RSH (Research) ADR creation from reference documents

Next Phase: Process 21 reference PDFs into structured RSH ADRs
