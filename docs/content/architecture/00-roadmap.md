## **Phase 2: Django Backend Infrastructure & Hosting**  
### **Key Goals:**
- Build and deploy a scalable Django backend.
- Establish a **free-to-paid funnel** without upfront paid requirements.
- Ensure **quantum-secure encryption** and **data sensitivity segmentation** between worker nodes and cloud systems.

### **Implementation Plan:**
- **Early-stage (MVP) Hosting:** Use **Render** for easy GitHub auto-deployment. **(15 hrs)**
- Implement **Django REST Framework (DRF)** for structured API endpoints. **(10 hrs)**
- Establish authentication via **JWT or OAuth2** (Django Allauth or djoser). **(10 hrs)**
- Use **PostgreSQL** as the primary database. **(10 hrs)**
- **GraphQL (Graphene-Django) will be introduced later** for **AI-driven query flexibility** (not needed initially). **(5 hrs)**
- Enable **Redis caching** to reduce query load. **(5 hrs)**
- Implement **rate limiting & security mechanisms** (Django‚Äôs built-in security, CORS headers). **(5 hrs)**
- Establish a **database schema migration strategy** using Django Migrations. **(5 hrs)**
- Encrypt sensitive model data using **Kyber/Dilithium/Falcon for quantum security**. **(5 hrs)**
- Set up **Celery + Redis** for async task execution. **(10 hrs)**
- Optimize database queries using **`select_related` and `prefetch_related`**. **(5 hrs)**
- Implement API response caching for performance improvements. **(5 hrs)**
- **Segment sensitive AI workloads** to **worker nodes instead of cloud storage**. **(5 hrs)**
- **Linting:** Use **Flake8**, **Black**, and **Ruff** for code formatting. **(5 hrs)**
- **Testing:** Use **Pytest-Django** for backend unit tests. **(5 hrs)**
- **API Testing:** Use **Postman/Newman** for API validation. **(5 hrs)**
- **CI/CD:** Automate deployments using **GitHub Actions**. **(5 hrs)**
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Ensure consistent formatting with Black and Isort. **(5 hrs)**
- **Security Audits:** Regularly run vulnerability scans to ensure compliance with **NIST AI cybersecurity best practices**. **(5 hrs)**

## **Phase 3: AI Fine-Tuning & Worker Node Setup**  
### **Key Goals:**
- Develop AI fine-tuning infrastructure.
- Configure worker node for self-hosted AI tasks.
- Establish model swapping strategies to preserve fine-tuned data.
- Implement revenue streams for fine-tuning services.

## **Phase 4: AI-Powered Customer Service Agents**
### **Key Goals:**
