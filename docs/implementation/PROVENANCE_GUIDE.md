# Provenance Guide (Pointer)

Implement PROV-O with Entities/Activities/Agents and record ingestion, bias, and extraction events.
Initial Cypher patterns are generated by apps/provenance/prov_logging.py.
Production wiring adds driver sessions, retention, and C2PA-style manifests.

## Write Path
- Module: `apps/provenance/neo4j_write.py`
- Env: `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USER`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`
- Function: `write_ingestion_event(ev, driver=None)` â€” accepts injected driver for tests; uses env when not provided.

## Ingestion Upload
- Module: `apps/document_processor/upload.py`
- Functions: `upload_bytes(...)`, `upload_file(...)`
- Behavior: inject a MinIO-compatible client with `put_object(...)`. We infer content-type (e.g., markdown/json/pdf) and construct deterministic object keys under `UPLOAD_PREFIX` (default `docs/`).
