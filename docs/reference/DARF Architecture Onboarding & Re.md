# DARF Architecture Onboarding & Research Synthesis

## Project Identity Validation: DARF Framework

**Assessment**: The **Deliberative Agentic Reasoning Framework (DARF)** naming aligns excellently with the research space and production goals:

‚úÖ **"Deliberative"** - Captures the bargaining/negotiation approach over simple majority rule  
‚úÖ **"Agentic"** - Centers on identity-sovereign agents as the core abstraction  
‚úÖ **"Reasoning"** - Emphasizes the constitutional constraint system and ADR-driven decision making  
‚úÖ **"Framework"** - Positions as infrastructure for others to build upon  

**Tagline validation**: *"Identity-sovereign agents; delegated mandates in the commons; deliberation over majority"* - Precise and differentiated from existing AI governance approaches.

**Domain fit**: `darf.tech` works well for technical positioning while avoiding crypto/speculative associations.

## Current Architecture State

### Completed Foundation
- **Phase 0**: PostgreSQL foundation, SQLAlchemy tested, Turborepo initialized
- **ADR System**: 27 documented decisions including governance framework
- **Research Validation**: ADR modernization framework proven as legitimate breakthrough
- **Tech Stack**: Core components operational (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Qdrant, RabbitMQ, Dramatiq, Redis, MinIO)

### Active Development Threads
1. **Core ADR System**: HTN planner and BDI reactor implementation
2. **Privacy Bridge**: Zero-knowledge proof integration design  
3. **Memory Tiles**: POC in `packages/governance-poc/`
4. **Trading Integration**: Research complete, awaiting time-series infrastructure

## Critical Architectural Decision Surfaces

Based on the constitutional AI handoff, four urgent architectural choices need resolution:

### 1. Inter-Agent Conflict Resolution
**Options**: Nash bargaining, CIRL-inspired cooperation, pre-approved fallback catalogs  
**Selection Criteria**: Pareto efficiency, budget compliance, local hardware tractability  
**Required**: Negotiation trace schema, budget contracts, fallback policies

### 2. Identity & Chain-of-Trust  
**Options**: Decentralized identifiers, k-of-n multi-signature, capability downshift  
**Selection Criteria**: Offline verification, recovery time, human factors  
**Required**: Identity binding records, actuation policies, recovery playbooks

### 3. Value Drift Detection & Recovery
**Options**: Scheduled re-elicitation, concept-drift signals, constitutional regression  
**Selection Criteria**: Sensitivity vs alert fatigue, compute cost, human comprehensibility  
**Required**: Drift monitors, hold state machines, regression suites

### 4. Meta-Constitutional Guardrails
**Options**: Minimal prohibitions, capability-tier gating, red-team checks  
**Selection Criteria**: Minimality, legal neutrality, testability  
**Required**: Capability-tier matrix, guardrail catalog, red-team cadence

## Sovereignty Model Implementation Plan

The "monarch at home, diplomat in public" model requires:

**Core Objects**: Personal Constitution, Mandate, Delegation Graph, Group Constitution, Proof-of-Decision  
**Authority Precedence**: Personal > Group for personal assets; Group > Personal only for explicitly mandated shared assets  
**Safety Mechanisms**: Budgeted actions, re-delegation limits, emergency stops, privacy by scope

## Research Preparation Strategy

### Phase 1: Constitutional AI Foundations (Week 1)## DARF Architectural Synthesis & Research Plan

Based on the comprehensive handoff and research conducted, I've synthesized the current state and developed a strategic architectural plan for the **Deliberative Agentic Reasoning Framework (DARF)**.

## ‚úÖ **DARF Naming Validation**

The DARF naming strongly aligns with Russell's constitutional AI principles, which emphasize machine uncertainty about human preferences and deference to human behavior as the source of preference information. The framework's focus on **deliberation over majority rule** maps perfectly to bargaining solution concepts like Nash and Kalai-Smorodinsky solutions, which handle multi-agent cooperation through negotiation rather than simple voting.

**Verdict**: `darf.tech` is strategically positioned and differentiated from existing AI governance approaches.

## üèóÔ∏è **Critical Architectural Decision Analysis**

### 1. **Inter-Agent Conflict Resolution Architecture**

**Research Findings**: The Kalai-Smorodinsky solution equalizes relative gains and maximizes equal value, while Nash solution maximizes product of normalized utilities. Recent work shows KS bargaining enhances decision quality and fairness in large-scale group decision-making scenarios.

**Architectural Recommendation**: 
- **Primary**: Kalai-Smorodinsky solution for fairness in agent cooperation
- **Fallback**: Nash solution for computational efficiency when KS fails
- **Safety**: Pre-approved fallback catalogs with budget enforcement

**Implementation Priority**: **HIGH** - Core to sovereignty model

### 2. **Identity & Chain-of-Trust Architecture**

**Research Findings**: Modern decentralized identity using DIDs enables offline verification with zero-knowledge proofs for selective disclosure while maintaining cryptographically verifiable attestations. Verifiable Credentials can include advanced privacy-preserving technologies with selective disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs.

**Architectural Recommendation**:
- **Identity Layer**: W3C DIDs with offline-capable verification
- **Credential Layer**: Verifiable Credentials with ZKP-based selective disclosure  
- **Recovery**: k-of-n multi-signature with time-locked constitutional amendments
- **Attestation**: ZKPs enable verification of essential information through smart contracts without storing sensitive data

**Implementation Priority**: **HIGH** - Foundation for all governance

### 3. **Value Drift Detection & Recovery Architecture**

**Research Findings**: Concept drift occurs when the relationship between input features and target variables changes over time, requiring proactive monitoring with statistical tests and automated alerts. Detection methods include monitoring model quality metrics, prediction drift, data drift, and correlation changes.

**Architectural Recommendation**:
- **Drift Monitors**: ADWIN (Adaptive Windowing) for streaming data, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for batched data
- **Hold States**: Progressive capability downshift during drift periods
- **Re-elicitation**: Scheduled preference confirmation with debounce windows
- **Constitutional Regression**: Stable behavior verification suite

**Implementation Priority**: **MEDIUM** - Post-core system deployment

### 4. **Meta-Constitutional Guardrails Architecture** 

**Research Findings**: Deontic logic provides formal representation of norms and obligations, with LegalRuleML offering machine-readable legal rule representation. LegalRuleML can be transformed into modal defeasible logic for automated compliance checking with deontic effects.

**Architectural Recommendation**:
- **Deontic Layer**: Defeasible Deontic Logic (DDL) for domain-neutral, computationally efficient normative specifications
- **Capability Tiers**: Progressive privilege escalation with proof requirements
- **Legal Encoding**: LegalRuleML for machine-readable constitutional constraints  
- **Red-Team Gates**: Scheduled deception/bypass testing for tier promotion

**Implementation Priority**: **MEDIUM** - Critical for enterprise adoption
