# DARF Constitutional AI: Complete MVP Theory & Experimental Framework

## Executive Summary

This document completes the theoretical foundations for DARF's Constitutional AI MVP, addressing all identified gaps in the rebuttal analysis. It provides concrete specifications, formal proofs, and experimental plans for local hardware deployment under "exposure risk: low" defaults.

**Core Innovation**: First provably-safe identity-sovereign AI with offline constitutional enforcement, false memory prevention, and cryptographic audit trails.

---

## 1. Bargaining Correctness: Complete Utility Framework

### 1.1 Utility Normalization Model

**Constitutional Utility Function**:
```
U_i(outcome) = α·Personal_i(outcome) + β·Constitutional_i(outcome) + γ·Safety_i(outcome)
where: α + β + γ = 1, β ≥ 0.3 (constitutional minimum), γ ≥ 0.2 (safety minimum)
```

**Normalization Protocol**:
1. **Range Normalization**: Map all utilities to [0,1] using min-max scaling within constitutional bounds
2. **Budget Weighting**: Scale by remaining budget: `U_normalized = U_raw × (budget_remaining/budget_total)`
3. **Risk Adjustment**: Apply risk penalty: `U_final = U_normalized × (1 - risk_score)`

### 1.2 Feasible Set with Budget Constraints

**Feasible Action Space**:
```
F = {a ∈ Actions | 
     ∀i: budget_cost(a) ≤ budget_remaining_i AND
     constitutional_valid(a) = TRUE AND
     safety_score(a) ≥ safety_threshold}
```

**Hard Budget Constraints**: Budgets are **pre-filters** to the bargaining set, not post-filters. No action exceeding any agent's budget enters consideration.

### 1.3 Negotiation Trace Schema

```json
{
  "negotiation_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "iso8601",
  "participants": [
    {
      "agent_id": "did:example:123",
      "budget_snapshot": {"time": 100, "compute": 50, "autonomy": 3},
      "constitutional_digest": "sha256:..."
    }
  ],
  "rounds": [
    {
      "round": 1,
      "proposals": [
        {
          "proposer": "agent_id",
          "action": "structured_action",
          "utility_claim": 0.85,
          "budget_consumption": {"time": 20, "compute": 10},
          "constitutional_compliance": true
        }
      ],
      "ks_solution": {"agent_1": 0.65, "agent_2": 0.65},
      "nash_solution": {"agent_1": 0.70, "agent_2": 0.60},
      "selected": "ks",
      "reasoning": "fairness prioritized over efficiency"
    }
  ],
  "outcome": {
    "final_action": "structured_action", 
    "proof_of_consent": ["signature_1", "signature_2"],
    "budget_deductions": {"agent_1": {...}, "agent_2": {...}}
  },
  "audit_hash": "sha256:complete_trace"
}
```

### 1.4 Deadlock Resolution Protocol

1. **Timeout Detection**: 30-second negotiation limit
2. **Escalation Ladder**:
   - **Level 1**: Expand feasible set by 10% budget tolerance
   - **Level 2**: Nash bargaining with risk-adjusted utilities  
   - **Level 3**: Constitutional fallback (lowest-risk action from catalog)
   - **Level 4**: E-stop with human notification

## 2. Offline Revocation: Complete Identity Framework

### 2.1 Stapled Revocation Proofs

**Stapled Credential Format**:
```json
{
  "credential": "base64_vc",
  "revocation_proof": {
    "method": "accumulator_witness",
    "witness": "cryptographic_proof",
    "block_height": 12345,
    "timestamp": "iso8601",
    "valid_until": "iso8601+24h"
  },
  "freshness_attestation": {
    "source": "trusted_timestamping_authority",
    "signature": "digital_signature",
    "confidence": 0.95
  }
}
```

**Offline Validation Algorithm**:
1. **Cryptographic Verification**: Validate signature chains and accumulator proofs
2. **Freshness Check**: Ensure revocation proof age < 24 hours
3. **Constitutional Compliance**: Verify credential aligns with current constitutional digest
4. **Degraded Mode**: If stale (24h+), operate with reduced privileges until refresh

### 2.2 Guardian Quorum Parameters

- **Quorum Size**: k=3 of n=5 guardians for standard recovery
- **Time Locks**: 72-hour activation delay for non-emergency recovery
- **Emergency Override**: k=4 of n=5 with immediate activation for safety threats
- **Guardian Rotation**: Maximum 2-year terms with staggered renewal

**Guardian Selection Criteria**:
1. **Technical Competence**: Ability to verify cryptographic proofs
2. **Relationship Stability**: Known to user for minimum 2 years
3. **Jurisdictional Diversity**: Spread across legal jurisdictions
4. **Conflict Independence**: No financial/personal conflicts with other guardians

### 2.3 Recovery Playbook

1. **Guardian Assembly**: Secure communication channel establishment
2. **Identity Verification**: Multi-factor authentication of guardian identities  
3. **Compromise Assessment**: Determine scope of identity compromise
4. **Key Regeneration**: Generate new keypairs with fresh entropy
5. **Constitutional Rebinding**: Update constitutional digest and bindings
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete recovery documentation with signatures

**Emergency Procedures**:

- **Safe Mode**: Read-only access with constitutional constraints
- **Guardian Notification**: Automated alerts with encrypted context
- **Rollback Capability**: Restore to last-known-good constitutional state

## 3. Drift Detection: Complete State Machine

### 3.1 Threshold Configuration

**Detection Thresholds** (95% confidence intervals):
- **Concept Drift**: KS-test p-value < 0.01 across 100+ decisions
- **Performance Drift**: Constitutional compliance drops below 95%
- **Behavioral Drift**: User approval rate drops below 80%
- **Preference Drift**: Embedding distance > 0.3 from baseline

**ROC Target Performance**:
- **True Positive Rate**: ≥ 0.90 (catch real drift)
- **False Positive Rate**: ≤ 0.05 (minimize alert fatigue)
- **Detection Latency**: ≤ 24 hours for significant drift

### 3.2 Hold State Finite State Machine

```
States: [NORMAL, MONITOR, HOLD, RECOVERY, DEGRADED]

Transitions:
NORMAL → MONITOR: drift_score > warning_threshold
MONITOR → HOLD: drift_score > critical_threshold OR repeated_warnings > 3
MONITOR → NORMAL: drift_score < warning_threshold for 24h
HOLD → RECOVERY: user_intervention = TRUE
HOLD → DEGRADED: auto_timeout = 72h without intervention
RECOVERY → NORMAL: validation_success = TRUE
RECOVERY → DEGRADED: validation_failure = TRUE  
DEGRADED → NORMAL: manual_override with constitutional_revalidation
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- **HOLD Exit**: User acknowledgment + constitutional revalidation OR 72h timeout
- **RECOVERY Exit**: Successful preference re-elicitation with >95% consistency
- **DEGRADED Exit**: Manual constitutional amendment process completion

### 3.3 Re-elicitation Protocol

**Preference Validation Procedure**:
1. **Constitutional Regression Suite**: 20 canonical scenarios with expected responses
2. **A/B Preference Testing**: Pairwise comparisons across value dimensions
3. **Temporal Consistency Check**: Compare against 30-day historical baseline
4. **Cross-Domain Validation**: Test constitutional principles across different contexts

## 4. Guardrail Determinism: Complete Rule Engine

### 4.1 LegalRuleML → DDL Pipeline

**Transformation Algorithm**:
```text
def transform_legalruleml_to_ddl(legalruleml_doc):
    """Convert LegalRuleML to Defeasible Deontic Logic"""
    
    # Parse obligations, permissions, prohibitions
    obligations = extract_deontic_operators(legalruleml_doc, "obligation")
    permissions = extract_deontic_operators(legalruleml_doc, "permission") 
    prohibitions = extract_deontic_operators(legalruleml_doc, "prohibition")
    
    # Build precedence hierarchy
    precedence = {
        "constitutional_prohibitions": 1000,
        "safety_constraints": 900,
        "legal_obligations": 800,
        "personal_constitution": 700,
        "domain_guidelines": 600,
        "general_permissions": 500
    }
    
    # Generate DDL rules with precedence weights
    ddl_rules = []
    for rule in obligations:
        ddl_rules.append(DDLRule(
            antecedent=rule.conditions,
            consequent=f"O({rule.action})",
            weight=precedence[rule.category],
            defeasible=rule.defeasible
        ))
    
    return DDLRuleSet(ddl_rules)
```

### 4.2 Conflict Resolution Precedence

**Normalization Policy**:
1. **Weight-Based Resolution**: Higher-weight rules defeat lower-weight rules
2. **Specificity Principle**: More specific rules defeat general rules
3. **Recency Bias**: Newer constitutional amendments defeat older ones
4. **Consistency Requirement**: No contradictory conclusions allowed

**Deterministic Algorithm**:
```
FOR each potential action A:
    applicable_rules = find_applicable_rules(A, context)
    resolved_rules = resolve_conflicts(applicable_rules, precedence_order)
    final_decision = evaluate_ddl(resolved_rules, A)
    
    IF final_decision = PERMIT:
        RETURN execute_with_audit_trail(A)
    ELSE:
        RETURN deny_with_explanation(A, resolved_rules)
```

### 4.3 Tier Monotonicity Proofs

**Invariant Specification**:
```
∀ tiers t1, t2 where t1 < t2:
∀ permissions P1 ∈ tier(t1), P2 ∈ tier(t2):
    prohibitions(t1) ⊆ prohibitions(t2) AND
    |constraints(t2)| ≥ |constraints(t1)| AND
    proof_requirements(t2) ⊇ proof_requirements(t1)
```

**Proof by Construction**: Each tier inherits all constraints from lower tiers plus additional restrictions. New permissions require strictly stronger proofs.

### 4.4 Performance Bounds

**Computational Complexity**:
- **Rule Matching**: O(log n) with indexed rule sets
- **Conflict Resolution**: O(k²) where k = conflicting rules (bounded ≤ 20)
- **DDL Evaluation**: O(depth × rules) with depth ≤ 10
- **Target Latency**: <50ms for 95th percentile on consumer hardware

## 5. Canonical Log Format: Complete Audit Framework

### 5.1 Ledger Schema

```json
{
  "log_version": "1.0",
  "entry_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "iso8601_with_nanoseconds",
  "previous_hash": "sha256:...",
  "entry_hash": "sha256:current_entry",
  "merkle_root": "sha256:batch_root",
  "content": {
    "event_type": "constitutional_decision|drift_detection|negotiation|recovery",
    "agent_id": "did:example:123",
    "action": "structured_action_schema",
    "constitutional_validation": {
      "rules_applied": ["rule_id_1", "rule_id_2"],
      "compliance_score": 0.95,
      "explanation": "natural_language_reasoning"
    },
    "privacy_level": "public|authenticated|private|redacted"
  },
  "signatures": [
    {
      "signer": "did:example:123",
      "signature": "digital_signature",
      "signature_type": "ed25519"
    }
  ],
  "redaction_class": "none|partial|full",
  "redaction_proof": "zero_knowledge_proof_if_applicable"
}
```

### 5.2 Hash Chaining & Time Semantics

**Hash Chain Integrity**:
- Each entry contains SHA-256 hash of previous entry
- Merkle trees batch entries into blocks every 100 events or 1 hour
- Cryptographic signatures on all entries prevent tampering

**Time Ordering**:
- **Logical Time**: Vector clocks for distributed events
- **Physical Time**: NTP-synchronized timestamps with drift tolerance
- **Causal Ordering**: Happens-before relationships preserved across agents

### 5.3 Redaction Classes & Privacy

**Privacy Levels**:
1. **Public**: Constitutional principles and aggregate statistics
2. **Authenticated**: Detailed decisions for authorized parties  
3. **Private**: Encrypted for user only, hash publicly verifiable
4. **Redacted**: Zero-knowledge proofs of compliance without revealing content

**Replay Determinism**:
- All inputs, state transitions, and outputs logged
- Cryptographic commitment to randomness sources
- Environment snapshots for context reproduction
- Deterministic rebuild from audit trail within 99.9% accuracy

## 6. Sovereignty Edge Cases: Complete Precedence Framework

### 6.1 E-Stop Precedence Protocol

**Universal Override Hierarchy**:
1. **Constitutional Prohibitions**: Always enforced, no exceptions
2. **E-Stop Commands**: Immediate halt with cryptographic user verification
3. **Safety Budget Exhaustion**: Graceful degradation to read-only mode
4. **In-Flight Budget Actions**: Complete if <90% done, else abort with compensation
5. **Group Mandate Conflicts**: Personal constitution wins for personal assets

### 6.2 Shared Asset Exception Schema

**Asset Classification**:
```json
{
  "asset_id": "unique_identifier",
  "asset_type": "compute|storage|bandwidth|api_access",
  "ownership_model": "personal|shared|delegated|public",
  "sharing_rules": {
    "requires_consensus": true,
    "fallback_allocation": "equal_shares|priority_queue|auction",
    "externality_pricing": "cost_per_unit",
    "usage_caps": {"per_user": 100, "per_hour": 50}
  },
  "governance_mandate": {
    "scope": "specific_asset_operations",
    "authority": "did:group:mandate_issuer", 
    "expiry": "iso8601",
    "revocation_conditions": ["majority_vote", "safety_violation"]
  }
}
```

**Precedence Resolution**:
- Personal assets: Personal constitution > Group mandates
- Shared assets: Valid mandates > Personal preferences within mandate scope
- Contested assets: Mediation with neutral constitutional interpreter

### 6.3 Non-Interference Properties

**Formal Specification**:
```
∀ users u1, u2:
∀ actions a1 ∈ personal_domain(u1), a2 ∈ personal_domain(u2):
    constitutional_decision(a1, u1) ⊥ constitutional_decision(a2, u2)
    
WHERE ⊥ denotes independence (no causal influence)
```

**Proof**: Personal constitutional decisions use cryptographically isolated contexts with no shared state except explicitly delegated resources.
