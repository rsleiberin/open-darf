# DARF Constitutional AI Framework Research Packet v1.2

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive research packet addresses five critical technical appendices designed to resolve GPT-5 review blockers for the DARF Constitutional AI framework. The research synthesizes advanced methodologies across experimental validation, identity verification, operational safety, performance engineering, and constitutional compliance to create a robust offline-first AI system with cryptographic security guarantees.

**Key innovations include**: semantic entropy-based false memory detection achieving <1% target rates, decentralized identity architecture supporting 72-hour offline operation, graduated safe operating envelope constraints with "dialogue-first" principles, stage-based performance budgeting under 4-core/16GB constraints, and Pareto-optimal constitutional fallback mechanisms with complete auditability.

The framework successfully integrates constitutional AI principles with practical deployment requirements, ensuring ethical compliance while maintaining operational effectiveness in resource-constrained environments.

## Appendix FM-01: Experimental Protocol for False Memory Validation

### Operational Definitions and Confidence Scoring Framework

**False Memory Taxonomy with Severity Weighting:**
- **Fabricated Facts**: Entirely fictional information (severity: 1.0)
- **Fabricated Citations**: Non-existent sources cited (severity: 0.9)
- **Misattribution**: Correct information, wrong attribution (severity: 0.7)
- **Time/Location Distortion**: Accurate events, incorrect context (severity: 0.6)
- **Semantic Confabulations**: Inconsistent responses to equivalent queries (severity: 0.8)
- **Contextual Inconsistencies**: Self-contradictory information (severity: 0.5)

**>70% Confidence Scoring Implementation:**
Utilizes semantic entropy methodology for meaning-level uncertainty assessment rather than token-level confidence. **Confidence calculation**: P(confidence) = 1 - semantic_entropy, with multiple generation sampling (M=10, temperature=1.0) and bidirectional entailment clustering using DeBERTa-large-MNLI.

**Scoring rubric thresholds:**
- **High confidence** (≥90%): Full severity weighting (multiplier: 1.0)
- **Moderate confidence** (70-89%): Reduced weighting (multiplier: 0.8)
- **Low confidence** (50-69%): Minimal weighting (multiplier: 0.6)
- **Uncertain** (<50%): Excluded from false memory analysis

### Independent Rater Protocols and Statistical Validation

**Rater Qualification Requirements:**

- Minimum 40-hour training certification
- Inter-rater reliability threshold: Cohen's κ ≥ 0.75 with gold standard

**Multi-metric Reliability Assessment:**

**Joint operational validation:**
```text
def evaluate_constraints(system_state):
    violations = []
    if system_state.timeout < 3 * system_state.failure_threshold:
        violations.append("T≥3F_VIOLATION")
    if system_state.lease_duration > system_state.failure_threshold:
        violations.append("LEASE_VIOLATION")

    if available_budget >= full_constitutional_analysis_cost():
        return full_constitutional_analysis(input)
    elif available_budget >= simplified_analysis_cost():
