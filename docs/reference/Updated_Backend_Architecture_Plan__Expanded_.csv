Component,Purpose,Top Options,Priority,Priority Explanation
Graph Database,"Knowledge graph, semantic relationships, multi-hop reasoning",Neo4j,High,"Core to your 'second brain' architecture; required for semantic modeling, GraphRAG, and intelligent agent memory"
Relational Database,"Structured data, transactions, business logic, ACID compliance",PostgreSQL,High,"Essential for handling forms, stores, account data, ACID use cases, and structured logic"
Vector Database,"Semantic search, embedding similarity, LLM context recall","Qdrant, Milvus, Weaviate",Medium-High,"Supports RAG-style retrieval from AI-chunked documents, links well with graph for hybrid reasoning"
Object Storage (Local or Remote),"Store large media files (images, audio, video) and binary data, with hashes & metadata","MinIO (self-hosted S3), Local FS with hash index",Medium,Required for storing generative outputs or external references linked from graph/vector/postgres
Cache / Key-Value Store,"Fast, volatile data storage for API responses, token/session tracking, agent memory recall","Redis, Dragonfly, KeyDB",Medium,Improves performance and responsiveness of APIs and agents; not required for correctness but highly recommended
Document Store (Optional),Flexible ingestion point for messy/unstructured user submissions,"CouchDB, PouchDB, TinyDB",Low,Optional staging layer for offline-first apps or unstructured early prototyping; can be pruned later if not needed
ORM / Data Layer,Map backend data models to application logic and APIs,"SQLAlchemy (Postgres), OGM (Neo4j), Prisma (JS), Tortoise ORM (async Python)",High,"Essential for abstracting logic, enforcing structure, and exposing API layers without tight coupling"
RAG Retriever Component,"Bridge between vector search, graph traversal, and LLM prompt assembly","LlamaIndex, LangChain Retriever, Haystack",Medium,"Key to implementing GraphRAG workflows by unifying vector, graph, and relational lookups into agent-ready prompts"
Task/Job Queue System,"Handle background tasks, async jobs, long-running ingestion (e.g. file parsing, embedding generation, agent workflows)","Celery, RQ, Dramatiq, Arq",High,"Essential for local-first systems with AI ingestion, media pipelines, and non-blocking agent execution; pairs well with Redis or PostgreSQL"
Time-Series Database,"Capture time-stamped data like health metrics, location tracking, usage trends, etc.","InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, QuestDB",High (if tracking temporal data),"Critical for personal telemetry, wellness tracking, or environmental sensing; aligns with second-brain and life analytics features"
Event Store,"Capture immutable history of events for auditability, security, and behavior reconstruction","EventStoreDB, Axon Server, Apache Kafka (log-based)",Medium,"Supports secure, traceable change historyâ€”useful for agents, automation, and long-term observability"
