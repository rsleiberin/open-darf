## Context

This security architecture addresses unique vulnerabilities in AI agent systems operating in multi-tenant environments, including prompt injection attacks, context bleeding between sessions, and the need for strict data isolation between tenants and agent operations.

## Security Requirements

### Threat Model
- **AI-Specific Threats**: Prompt injection, context manipulation, model extraction attacks
- **Multi-Tenant Threats**: Cross-tenant data access, privilege escalation, data leakage
- **Agent-Specific Threats**: Autonomous malicious actions, resource abuse, unauthorized system access

### Security Objectives
1. **Data Isolation**: Zero cross-tenant or cross-session data access
2. **Agent Containment**: AI agents operate within strict permission boundaries
3. **Context Security**: Agent memory and context cannot leak between sessions
4. **Audit Transparency**: All agent actions are logged and traceable

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Isolation Design

#### Tenant Boundary Enforcement
- **Database Level**: Row-level security with mandatory TenantID filtering on all queries
- **Application Level**: Tenant context validation in all API endpoints
- **Infrastructure Level**: Namespace isolation in compute and storage resources

#### Data Segregation Strategy
- **Physical Separation**: Separate databases for high-security tenants
- **Logical Separation**: Schema-level isolation with encrypted tenant keys
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control with tenant-scoped permissions

### AI Agent Security Controls

#### Permission Sandboxing
- **Least Privilege**: Agents granted minimal necessary permissions for their specific role
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and network usage restrictions per agent
- **API Restrictions**: Agents limited to approved endpoint whitelist

#### Context Isolation
- **Session Boundaries**: Agent context automatically purged after session completion
- **Memory Encryption**: Agent working memory encrypted and tenant-scoped
- **State Management**: No persistent state sharing between different user sessions

#### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Prompt Injection Defense**: Multi-layer input sanitization and validation
- **Output Filtering**: Agent responses scanned for potential data leakage
- **Command Injection Prevention**: Strict validation of any system commands

### Security Monitoring & Response

#### Threat Detection
- **Anomaly Detection**: Real-time monitoring for unusual agent behavior patterns
- **Access Pattern Analysis**: Detection of suspicious data access or privilege escalation attempts
- **Performance Monitoring**: Resource usage monitoring to detect abuse or attacks

#### Incident Response
- **Automated Response**: Immediate agent suspension on security policy violation
- **Alert Systems**: Real-time notifications for security events
- **Forensic Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for incident investigation

## Implementation Strategy

### Security Controls Implementation

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all human administrative access
- **Service-to-Service Authentication**: Mutual TLS for inter-service communication
- **Agent Authentication**: Cryptographic agent identity verification

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Hardware security modules for encryption key protection

#### Network Security
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated network zones for different security levels
- **Firewall Rules**: Strict ingress/egress controls for agent network access
- **VPN Requirements**: Secure tunneling for remote administrative access

### Compliance & Governance

#### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data processing transparency and user rights implementation
- **SOC 2 Controls**: Security controls aligned with SOC 2 Type II requirements
- **Industry Standards**: Implementation of relevant security frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001)

#### Security Policies
- **Access Control Policy**: Formal policies for system and data access
- **Incident Response Policy**: Documented procedures for security incident handling
- **Data Handling Policy**: Guidelines for secure data processing and storage

## Testing & Validation

### Security Testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular third-party security assessments
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning for known vulnerabilities
- **Red Team Exercises**: Simulated attacks to test defense capabilities

### Compliance Validation
- **Security Audits**: Regular internal and external security audits
- **Control Testing**: Verification that security controls function as designed
- **Documentation Reviews**: Regular review and update of security documentation

## Operational Security

### Security Operations
- **24/7 Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of security events and alerts
- **Security Team**: Dedicated security personnel for monitoring and response
- **Tool Integration**: Security tools integrated with existing operational systems

### Business Continuity
- **Backup Security**: Secure backup and recovery procedures
- **Disaster Recovery**: Security considerations in disaster recovery planning
- **Continuity Testing**: Regular testing of security-related continuity procedures

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Scenarios
- **Multi-Tenant Data Breach**: Cross-tenant data access through agent manipulation
- **Prompt Injection Attack**: Malicious prompts causing unauthorized agent actions
- **Privilege Escalation**: Agents gaining unauthorized system or data access

### Risk Mitigation
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers to prevent single points of failure
- **Regular Updates**: Continuous updates to security controls and threat intelligence
- **User Training**: Security awareness training for all system users
