# ADR-2508-GOV-001: Personal Governance Framework

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Research validates a novel personal AI governance approach addressing:
- False memory prevention via memory tiles
- Digital sovereignty through constitutional constraints
- Post-mortem governance preventing orphaned agents
- Complete audit trails for regulatory compliance

## Decision
Adopt three-tier governance architecture:
1. Memory Management Layer (tiles with 72hr TTL)
2. Constitutional Enforcement Layer (hard constraints)
3. Lifecycle Governance Layer (heartbeat oracle)

## Evidence
- Neuroscience: 72-hour memory consolidation window
- Computer Science: Byzantine fault tolerance proven
- Legal: GDPR/CCPA compliance validated
- Market: No competing comprehensive solution

## Consequences
Positive:
- First complete personal governance framework
- Enables true digital sovereignty
- Prevents AI-induced false memories
- Solves orphaned agent problem

Negative:
- Complex implementation required
- Key management UX challenges
- Computational overhead
- Regulatory uncertainty
