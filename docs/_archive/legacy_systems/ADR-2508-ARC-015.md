## Context

This architecture decision defines the data layer design for a generative AI platform that must handle diverse data types ranging from structured user accounts to large JSON documents, vector embeddings, and binary objects. The architecture addresses the performance limitations of traditional single-database approaches when dealing with AI-generated content and training data.

## Architecture Overview

### System Scope
- All data storage and retrieval operations for the generative AI platform
- Data flow between application layer and multiple specialized storage systems
- Cross-database coordination and transaction management
- Data lifecycle management from creation to archival

### Architectural Drivers
1. **Data Type Diversity**: Need to efficiently store structured records, large JSON documents, high-dimensional vectors, and binary objects
2. **Performance Optimization**: Avoid "off-row" storage overhead in relational systems for large documents
3. **Scalability Requirements**: Support growth from prototype to production scale without architectural changes
4. **Security Isolation**: Implement multi-tenant data separation and AI agent security boundaries

## Architectural Pattern

### Core Pattern: Multi-Database Architecture with Specialized Storage

**Description**: A coordinated multi-database system where each database type is optimized for specific data characteristics and access patterns, unified through an application-level data abstraction layer.

**Key Components**:
- **Relational Database (PostgreSQL)**: Structured data with ACID guarantees
- **Document Database**: Semi-structured JSON data and AI outputs
- **Vector Database (Qdrant)**: High-dimensional embeddings for semantic search
- **Object Storage (MinIO)**: Binary files and large document archives
- **Data Abstraction Layer**: Application-level coordination and routing

### System Structure

The architecture employs a layered approach where the Application Layer communicates with a Data Abstraction Layer, which then coordinates access across four specialized storage systems: Relational Database for structured data, Document Database for JSON content, Vector Database for embeddings, and Object Storage for files. All storage systems implement a two-tier approach with local storage for active data and cloud backup for archival.

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Write Operations**: Data abstraction layer routes data to appropriate storage based on type and size
2. **Read Operations**: Coordinated queries across multiple databases with result aggregation
3. **Cross-Database Transactions**: Two-phase commit for operations spanning multiple storage systems
4. **Data Migration**: Automated tiering from local to cloud storage based on access patterns

## Component Design

### Relational Database (PostgreSQL)
**Purpose**: Store structured data requiring ACID guarantees and complex relational queries
**Responsibilities**:
- User accounts, authentication, and authorization data
- System configuration and metadata
- Small structured records with fixed schemas
- Cross-database transaction coordination
**Interfaces**: SQL API, connection pooling, read replicas
**Implementation**: PostgreSQL with tenant-scoped row-level security

### Document Database
**Purpose**: Efficiently store and query large, variable-structure JSON documents
**Responsibilities**:
- LLM outputs and conversation logs
- Training data and AI-generated content
- Dynamic configuration objects
- Semi-structured metadata
**Interfaces**: JSON query API, full-text search capabilities
**Implementation**: Document-optimized storage engine with JSON indexing

### Vector Database (Qdrant)
**Purpose**: High-performance similarity search for AI embeddings
**Responsibilities**:
- Document embeddings for RAG workflows
- Semantic search and similarity queries
- Vector indexing and approximate nearest neighbor search
- Metadata filtering combined with vector similarity
**Interfaces**: REST API, gRPC, Python client integration
**Implementation**: HNSW indexing with payload filtering capabilities

### Object Storage (MinIO)
**Purpose**: Scalable storage for large binary objects and file archives
**Responsibilities**:
- Large document files and media content
- Model artifacts and training datasets
- Backup archives and long-term retention
- Static asset serving
**Interfaces**: S3-compatible API, lifecycle management
**Implementation**: Local MinIO with S3 cloud tiering

### Data Abstraction Layer
**Purpose**: Unified interface coordinating access across specialized databases
**Responsibilities**:
- Data type routing and storage selection
- Cross-database query coordination
- Transaction management and consistency
- Tenant isolation enforcement
- Data lifecycle and migration policies
**Interfaces**: Application APIs, database connection management
**Implementation**: Application-level service with database-specific adapters

## Quality Attributes

### Performance Characteristics
- **Structured Queries**: <1ms response time for relational data
- **Document Retrieval**: <10ms for JSON documents up to 10MB
- **Vector Search**: <50ms for similarity queries on million-scale datasets
- **Object Access**: <100ms for file retrieval from local storage

### Reliability & Availability
- **Data Durability**: 99.99% for local tier, 99.999999999% for cloud tier
- **Cross-Database Consistency**: Eventual consistency with configurable consistency levels
- **Failure Isolation**: Individual database failures don't affect other storage types
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automated backup with 4-hour RTO, 15-minute RPO

### Security Architecture
- **Tenant Isolation**: Row-level security in relational, collection-level in document, namespace isolation in vector/object
- **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit across all storage types
- **Access Control**: Unified identity management with database-specific permission mapping
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail across all data access operations

### Scalability Design
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Each database type scales independently based on workload patterns
- **Vertical Scaling**: Resource allocation optimized per database type
- **Bottleneck Management**: Load balancing and read replicas for high-traffic operations

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Implement relational and object storage with basic abstraction layer
2. **Phase 2**: Add document database and vector search capabilities
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features including cross-database analytics and automated tiering

### Integration Points
- **Application Services**: Database abstraction layer provides unified data access APIs
- **Security Integration**: Tenant isolation enforced across all storage types
- **Monitoring Systems**: Unified observability across all database technologies

### Deployment Architecture
- **Local Deployment**: All database types co-located for development and small-scale production
- **Distributed Deployment**: Independent scaling and geographic distribution of storage types
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Local primary storage with cloud backup and disaster recovery

## Alternatives Considered

### Single Database Approach
**Description**: Use PostgreSQL with JSONB columns for all data types
**Advantages**: Simplified architecture, single technology stack, ACID guarantees
**Disadvantages**: Poor performance for large JSON documents, no vector search optimization, limited scalability for diverse workloads

### NoSQL-Only Architecture
**Description**: Use document database for all data storage needs
**Advantages**: Flexible schema, good JSON performance, horizontal scaling
**Disadvantages**: No ACID guarantees for critical data, poor relational query support, no vector search capabilities

### Pure Cloud Architecture
**Description**: Use managed cloud services for all storage needs
**Advantages**: No infrastructure management, automatic scaling, high availability
**Disadvantages**: Higher costs, network dependency, less control over performance and security
