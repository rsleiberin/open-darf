## Context

This process definition establishes systematic workflows for documentation contributions to support the transition from solo development to community-driven documentation while maintaining quality standards and enabling AI agent integration.

## Process Overview

**Primary Goal**: Enable high-quality documentation contributions from internal team members, external contributors, and AI agents while maintaining consistency and accuracy.

**Target Contributors**: Solo developer, future team members, open-source community contributors, AI documentation agents.

**Quality Standards**: All documentation changes must meet accuracy, clarity, consistency, and completeness requirements defined in the documentation architecture.

## Contribution Workflow

### Contributor Onboarding

#### New Contributor Setup
1. **Documentation Guidelines Review**: Contributors must read CONTRIBUTING.md and documentation style guide
2. **Template Access**: Provide access to documentation templates and examples
3. **Tool Setup**: Ensure contributors have necessary tools (Markdown editors, Git, preview capabilities)
4. **Test Contribution**: First contribution should be a small documentation improvement to validate workflow

#### Role Assignment
- **Solo Developer**: Full documentation authority, final approval for all changes
- **Team Members**: Direct commit access for minor changes, PR process for major updates
- **External Contributors**: Fork and pull request workflow with mandatory review
- **AI Agents**: Automated contributions via designated bot accounts with enhanced review

### Contribution Types

#### Minor Changes (Direct Commit)
**Scope**: Typo fixes, link updates, small clarifications
**Process**: Direct commit to main branch with descriptive commit message
**Requirements**: Changes affecting <10 lines, no structural modifications
**Validation**: Automated link checking and spell checking

#### Major Changes (Pull Request)
**Scope**: New sections, structural changes, new documents
**Process**: Feature branch → Pull Request → Review → Merge
**Requirements**: Template compliance, cross-reference updates, comprehensive testing
**Validation**: Manual review, automated testing, preview deployment

#### AI Agent Contributions
**Scope**: Template instantiation, content generation, consistency fixes
**Process**: Automated PR creation with enhanced validation requirements
**Requirements**: Human review mandatory, clear attribution, rollback capability
**Validation**: Enhanced automated testing, human approval required

### Review Process

#### Review Criteria
1. **Accuracy**: Technical content is correct and up-to-date
2. **Clarity**: Information is understandable to target audience
3. **Consistency**: Follows established style guide and terminology
4. **Completeness**: All necessary information is included
5. **Navigation**: Proper linking and cross-references maintained

#### Review Workflow
1. **Automated Checks**: Link validation, spell checking, format compliance
2. **Peer Review**: Technical accuracy verification by subject matter expert
3. **Style Review**: Consistency with documentation standards
4. **Final Approval**: Solo developer or designated maintainer approval
5. **Post-Merge Validation**: Verify deployment and user accessibility

#### Review Timeline
- **Minor Changes**: Same-day review and merge
- **Major Changes**: 48-hour review window for team input
- **External Contributions**: 7-day review window with feedback provided
- **AI Contributions**: 24-hour human review requirement

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Validation
- **Link Checking**: All internal and external links validated
- **Spell Checking**: Automated spell checking with technical term dictionary
- **Format Validation**: Markdown syntax and structure compliance
- **Template Compliance**: Verification of required sections and metadata

### Manual Review Standards
- **Technical Accuracy**: Subject matter expert verification
- **Audience Appropriateness**: Content suitable for intended users
- **Style Consistency**: Adherence to voice and tone guidelines
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Links and references properly maintained

### Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback Collection**: User feedback on documentation effectiveness
- **Usage Analytics**: Track which documentation is most/least accessed
- **Gap Analysis**: Regular assessment of documentation coverage
- **Process Optimization**: Regular review and refinement of contribution workflow

## Community Integration

### External Contributor Support
- **Clear Guidelines**: Comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md with examples
- **Responsive Feedback**: Timely and constructive review comments
- **Recognition System**: Contributor acknowledgment in release notes
- **Mentorship**: Guidance for first-time contributors

### Collaboration Tools
- **GitHub Integration**: Pull request workflow with automated checks
- **Preview Deployments**: Staged previews for review and testing
- **Discussion Threads**: Structured discussion for complex changes
- **Issue Templates**: Standardized issue creation for documentation requests

### Knowledge Transfer
- **Documentation of Process**: This process itself is documented and maintained
- **Reviewer Training**: Guidelines for effective documentation review
- **Best Practice Sharing**: Examples of excellent contributions
- **Institutional Memory**: Process evolution and decision rationale preserved

## AI Agent Integration

### Agent Contribution Framework
- **Automated Generation**: Templates and boilerplate content creation
- **Consistency Enforcement**: Automated fixes for style and format issues
- **Link Maintenance**: Automated link checking and update suggestions
- **Content Freshness**: Identification of outdated content requiring updates

### Human Oversight Requirements
- **Mandatory Review**: All AI contributions require human approval
- **Attribution**: Clear identification of AI-generated content
- **Quality Gates**: Enhanced validation for AI contributions
- **Rollback Capability**: Easy reversal of problematic AI changes

### Agent Boundaries
- **Approved Actions**: Template instantiation, format fixes, link updates
- **Restricted Actions**: New content creation, technical decisions, strategic changes
- **Escalation Points**: When agents should defer to human contributors
- **Error Handling**: How agents should respond to validation failures

## Technology Integration

### Tool Requirements
- **Version Control**: Git-based workflow with branch protection
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline for documentation validation
- **Preview Generation**: Automated preview builds for review
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automated deployment after approval

### Workflow Automation
- **PR Templates**: Standardized pull request descriptions
- **Automated Labeling**: Issue and PR categorization
- **Notification System**: Stakeholder alerts for relevant changes
- **Metrics Collection**: Contribution and review process analytics

## Success Metrics

### Contribution Metrics
- **Contribution Volume**: Number of documentation updates per month
- **Contributor Diversity**: Number of unique contributors
- **Review Efficiency**: Average time from submission to merge
- **Quality Indicators**: Rate of post-merge corrections needed

### Community Metrics
- **External Participation**: Community member contribution rate
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback scores on documentation quality
- **Issue Resolution**: Time to address documentation issues
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Successful onboarding of new contributors

## Risk Mitigation

### Quality Risks
- **Inaccurate Information**: Multiple review layers and subject matter expert validation
