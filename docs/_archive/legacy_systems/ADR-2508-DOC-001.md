## Context

This ADR establishes a comprehensive documentation architecture for a solo developer studio that aims to automate operations, grow sustainably, and maintain alignment with open-source best practices. The strategy addresses the unique challenge of building professional-grade documentation systems that can scale from solo development to team collaboration while enabling autonomous AI agent integration.

## Documentation Requirements

**Primary Drivers**:
- Enable sustainable growth from solo to team development
- Support AI agent integration and autonomous contributions
- Maintain open-source community standards and best practices
- Reduce operational overhead through automation
- Enable knowledge transfer and succession planning

**Target Audiences**:
- Solo developer (current maintainer)
- Future team members and contributors
- Open-source community members
- AI agents and autonomous tools
- Enterprise users evaluating the project

**Scalability Needs**:
- Documentation must evolve seamlessly as team grows
- Support transition from manual to automated maintenance
- Enable AI agents to understand and contribute to documentation
- Maintain consistency across all documentation types

## Documentation Architecture

### Document Taxonomy

Based on comprehensive analysis of solo developer studio needs and open-source best practices:

1. **README.md**: Project entry point, installation, usage, and community links
2. **LICENSE**: Legal terms and usage rights declaration
3. **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Contribution guidelines, development setup, and standards
4. **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Community behavior standards and enforcement
5. **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System design, components, and technical decisions
6. **UI/UX Documentation**: Design systems, component guidelines, accessibility standards
7. **Agent Orchestration Documentation**: AI agent design, coordination, and workflows
8. **Automation Workflow Documentation**: CI/CD, deployment, and operational automation
9. **SECURITY.md**: Vulnerability reporting and security practices
10. **Compliance & Privacy Documentation**: GDPR, regulatory requirements, data handling
11. **SUPPORT.md**: Help channels, FAQ, and support expectations
12. **ROADMAP.md**: Future plans, milestones, and community involvement opportunities
13. **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history, changes, and release notes

### Content Strategy
