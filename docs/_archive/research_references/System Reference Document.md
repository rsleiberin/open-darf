# 2\. Design Tokens

## 2.1 Luminosity and Color

This design system prioritizes defining components based on their luminosity, ensuring a foundation rooted in perceived brightness and accessibility. By establishing luminosity as the primary metric, we create a consistent baseline that can be translated into various color spaces for flexibility and adaptability. This approach enables seamless transformations to accommodate accessibility requirements, such as color blindness, and to integrate locally associated rich media, enhancing the visual experience while maintaining functional integrity.

### 2.1.1 What Is Luminosity

Luminosity, in the context of design and accessibility, refers to the perceived brightness of a color as seen by the human eye. Unlike the raw intensity of light emitted by a display, luminosity accounts for human vision’s sensitivity to different wavelengths, with green being the most prominent, followed by red, and then blue. This characteristic makes luminosity a fundamental aspect of visual design, influencing how easily users can distinguish elements on a screen. By starting with luminosity, we establish a foundation for understanding color contrast and accessibility, ensuring that design choices accommodate a wide range of visual abilities and device technologies.

### 2.1.2 Calculating Luminosity

Luminosity palettes differ based on user preferences such as theme and accessibility which are sometimes mutually exclusive. User Interface is inherently designed in sRGB color space and requires designers to calculate luminosity based on the following equations as defined by WCAG:

#### 2.1.2.1 Normalize the RGB Values

Most color processing calculations require normalized values to ensure consistency, especially when working across different bit depths or color systems. By normalizing, the values are expressed as percentages of their maximum possible value. In this step, the RGB values from the typical 8-bit integer range \[0, 255\] are normalized to the range \[0, 1\].

**`XsRGB = X8bit255`**

Where XsRGB represents the normalized 8bit value of either the red, green, or blue value in standard RGB space (sRGB)

#### 2.1.1.2 Linearize the Normalized Values

The normalized RGB values (RsRGB, GsRGB, BsRGB) represent color intensities, but they aren't proportional to the actual light emitted because of gamma correction in the sRGB color space. To work with true light intensity, we need to reverse the gamma correction. This process is called linearization.

For any normalized color component (XsRGB):

* If XsRGB  0.04045:

Xlinear= XsRGB12.92

* If XsRGB \> 0.04045:

Xlinear=(XsRGB+0.0551.055)

#### 2.1.1.3 Find Relative Luminance

Once we have the linearized values (Rlinear​ ,Glinear​ ,Blinear​ ), we use linear components to compute the relative luminance (𝐿). The formula assigns different weights to each linearized component because the human eye is most sensitive to green light, less sensitive to red, and least sensitive to blue. These weights come from the ITU-R BT.709 standard.

L=0.2126Rlinear+0.7152Glinear+0.0722Blinear

The coefficients for each component are derived from the standard for human perception of brightness. The resulting product is the relative luminance, normalized between zero and one.

#### 2.1.1.4 Achromatic Design Feature

In achromatic colors, all sRGB components share the same value, meaning the linearized components are also equal to one another. Consequently, the relative luminance of an achromatic color is identical to the value of any individual linearized component. This simplifies calculations, as normalization and linearization need to be performed on only a single channel, significantly reducing computational overhead. For this reason, all components in this design system will be prototyped using achromatic styling, ensuring consistency and efficiency in the initial design phase before applying broader color transformations.

### 2.1.2 Contrast Ratios

Contrast is a cornerstone of effective design, shaping how users perceive and interact with visual elements. It defines shapes and boundaries, enabling users to distinguish between components and understand their function. By leveraging differences in brightness and color, contrast allows designs to communicate relationships, priorities, and actions effectively. This principle aligns with the guidelines established by WCAG, which provide minimum and maximum contrast ratios to ensure that designs remain legible and accessible for all users, including those with visual impairments. By prioritizing contrast, we ensure that our designs are visually clear, intuitive, and inclusive.

#### 2.1.2.1 Calculating Luminosity Contrast Ratios

Luminosity Contrast Ratios measure the difference in brightness between two relative luminosities. It's a key metric for ensuring visual accessibility, as defined by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This ratio determines how easily a foreground element (e.g., a button or text) can be distinguished from its background.

The contrast ratio (CR) between two colors with relative luminance values of L1, the lighter color, and L2, the darker color, is calculated as:

CR=L1+0.05L2+0.05

The constant 0.05 is added to both luminance values to account for perceived brightness differences in very dark colors.

#### 2.1.2.2 Deriving Target Luminance From Target Contrast Ratio

To create accessible designs, it is often necessary to determine a luminosity that meets a specific contrast ratio to an existing background or foreground luminosity. By manipulating the contrast ratio formula, the precise luminance (L) required to achieve the desired contrast can be calculated, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards.

To solve for the unknown luminance (Ltarget) the contrast ratio formula can be rewritten using a known luminosity value.

If the unknown luminosity is lighter (L1):

L1=(CR(L2+0.05))-0.05

If the unknown luminosity is darker (L2):

L2=L1+0.05CR-0.05

### 2.1.3 Determining Luminosity Pallette Range and WCAG Compliance

####

#### Mechanical Considerations and Minimum Luminosity

Darker colors are rendered inconsistently across devices. To ensure a consistent visual experience RGB 18,18,18 (\#121212) is the darkest rendered luminosity. Accessibility settings targeting color blindness will reduce the corresponding channel to 18 to maintain consistent degradation rates on all channels of the LED but must calculate perceived luminance using only the single channel.

##### Luminosity Baseline Table:

#### Halation Effect and Maximum Luminosity

Halation occurs when areas of high luminosity bleed into surrounding darker regions, causing visual artifacts that can obscure content and reduce legibility. This effect is particularly noticeable in high-contrast scenarios, where extreme brightness creates an overpowering glare or halo, straining the user's eyes and impairing their ability to discern fine details. Maximum Luminosity will be capped at a 15:1 luminosity contrast ratio as defined by WCAG as the

2.1.3 Opacity

Use 10% increments ranging from 0% (fully transparent) to 100% (fully opaque). Maintain similar opacity settings for elements within the same layer, while elements at higher layers should use less transparency to enhance their prominence and establish a clear visual hierarchy.

### 2.1.2 Gradients and Glass

#### Design Considerations

Gradients should be used thoughtfully, ensuring they add visual interest without overwhelming the user. When applying gradients, consider how they interact with surrounding elements and whether they help guide the user’s attention. Subtlety is key—ensure smooth transitions between hues and maintain readability when text overlays gradients. Gradients can also create depth by suggesting light sources and shadows, giving elements a dimensional feel.

Glass will be substituted with basic opacity at a defined level

Gradients

Gradients are a vital design element that adds depth, dimension, and visual interest to the user interface. This system uses gradients across various elements, ranging from backgrounds to buttons, providing a seamless visual flow. The following guidelines outline best practices for creating and implementing gradients in our design system.

#### Types of Gradients

* Linear Gradients: Transition between colors along a straight line, suitable for backgrounds, buttons, or overlay effects. These gradients can be implemented using the linear-gradient() CSS function, providing clean, straightforward transitions between two or more colors.
* Radial Gradients: Radiate from a central point, making them ideal for highlighting central elements, like circular buttons or logos. The radial-gradient() function allows for flexible control over the shape and spread of the gradient.
* Conic Gradients: Transition colors around a central point in a circular motion, offering dynamic effects for charts or circular components. These can be created using the conic-gradient() function in CSS, providing rotation-based transitions.
* Diamond Gradients: Originate from a central point in a diamond shape, fitting well within quadrilateral designs. This effect can be achieved using the linear-gradient() function at specific angles to create the diamond effect.
* Reflected Gradients: Mirror the gradient across a central axis, producing a symmetrical, mirrored effect that works well for balanced designs. The linear-gradient() function, paired with specific angles, is used to achieve this reflection.
* Multi-Point Gradients: Gradients that transition across multiple points or colors. These can be useful for complex, artistic designs where standard two-color gradients don't suffice. Multi-point gradients are created using multiple color stops within the linear-gradient() or radial-gradient() functions.

#### Gradient Combinations

Two-Color Gradients: The default and most common type, these provide a simple, clean transition between two shades. Ideal for maintaining a cohesive, understated design.

Multi-Color Gradients: Use multi-color gradients sparingly to add complexity or emphasis. When used, ensure transitions between colors are smooth, avoiding muddy or harsh color shifts. Multi-color gradients should be applied in cases where a design element benefits from added visual depth or complexity.

### 2.1.4 Background Colors and Voice

The background luminosity denotes the speaker of the content. The content colors are grouped as follows: Other colors of the palette are reserved for responsive decorative elements and are not expected to meet wcag guidelines for contrast ratio.

Black Background: Voice of the Author

Backgrounds: Darkmode vs Light mode

Dark Background: Voice of Other, data contributions and aggregate works from others or non-personal voice of Author. Also the interactive space for user to contribute. (qualitative input)

Light Background: Action spaces for the user, non-qualitative input, usually utility for changing the UI, like navigation or Icons.

Glass Black/White: Backgrounds representing the Brand or Agent voice.
.

## 2.2 Grid System and Spacing

####

### 2.2.1 Fractional Units

The grid system uses fractional units (fr) to maintain a flexible and scalable layout. Each fractional unit equals 16px, aligning with the base rem size for consistency across the system. Both columns and margins use fractional units to ensure a uniform, responsive structure.

####

### 2.2.2 Breakpoints and Columns

The grid adapts to three breakpoints:

* Desktop (1360px and above): 12 columns
* Tablet (688px to 1360px): 6 columns
* Mobile (352px to 688px): 3 columns


Columns are set to 6fr, with a minmax() function ensuring a width between 96px and 256px. Once columns reach 256px, extra space is allocated to margins.

### 2.2.3 Margins

Margins are fixed at 1fr with a minimum of 16px. Margins expand as needed when columns reach their maximum size, ensuring balanced content presentation without overcrowding.

### 2.2.4 Gutters

Gutters are set to 16px across all breakpoints, maintaining consistent spacing between columns.

### 2.2.5 ARIA and Accessibility

The grid system integrates ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility and ensure compatibility with assistive technologies. Specific ARIA roles are used to define key structural elements of the grid for navigation and interaction by screen readers.

For detailed information on ARIA roles, please refer to [ARIA’s official documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles/).

In this system, dynamic adjustments to the grid layout (e.g., resizing or reflowing content) are supported by ARIA attributes, allowing real-time updates to assistive devices. Focusable elements maintain consistent accessibility as the layout shifts, ensuring smooth keyboard navigation across all breakpoints.

## 2.3 Typography

Typography is a critical aspect of design that affects readability, hierarchy, and overall user experience. This section defines the typographic elements, their use cases, and best practices for implementation.

### 2.3.1 Font Families and Typographic Flexibility

This system primarily relies on Roboto Flex and Roboto Serif, leveraging their variable-font capabilities for responsive design. These fonts allow dynamic adjustments for weight, width, and optical sizing, providing flexibility and consistency across devices. Roboto (legacy) is included as a fallback for browsers that do not support variable fonts, while Noto ensures coverage for scripts and glyphs not supported by Roboto.

* Roboto Flex: A variable font that adapts weight, width, and optical sizing automatically based on the context, ensuring optimal readability across different devices.
* Roboto Serif: Similar to Roboto Flex, but with serif styling for longer text or more traditional aesthetics. Automatic adjustments ensure consistency without manual intervention.
* Roboto (Legacy): Included as a fallback for legacy browsers, with predefined weights for consistency where variable fonts are not supported.
* Noto: Supports languages and scripts not covered by Roboto, offering a comprehensive solution for multilingual content.

#### Legibility & Readability

Typography choices prioritize legibility across all devices:

* Roboto Sans-Serif is used for display headings and headers to ensure clean, clear titles that are easy to read from a distance or in large formats.
* Roboto Serif is selected for body text, providing comfortable readability for longer paragraphs, especially in articles and blogs.

### 2.3.2 Type Scale and Responsive Typography

The Janus design system utilizes a Major Third ratio (1.25) for its typographic hierarchy, ensuring a structured and consistent scaling across all text levels. All font sizes, line heights, and spacing are defined using rem units, allowing proportional scaling relative to the root font size.

#### Type Scale Hierarchy

The type scale is structured as follows:

* Display: D1, D2 for large, prominent headings.
* Headings: H1 to H6 for descending header levels.
* Body Text: Body Large and Body Medium.

#### Line Height:

* Body Text: Set to 1.5 times the font size to ensure readability and adherence to WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards. This setting helps maintain a comfortable reading experience for longer text passages.
* Heading and Display Text: Set to 1.25 times the font size, providing a balanced appearance for larger text without excessive spacing.

All line heights are rounded up to the nearest multiple of 8px to align with the 8-point grid, ensuring consistent vertical rhythm across all elements.

#### Paragraph Spacing

Set to 2 times the font size to ensure readability and adherence to WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards. Paragraph spacing is rounded up to the nearest multiple of 8px, ensuring clear separation between paragraphs and maintaining alignment with the 8-point grid.

#### Responsive Typography

The system combines rem and em units:

* rem: Used for base font sizes, line heights, margins, and padding, ensuring consistent scaling across screen sizes.
* em: Applied for element-specific properties like letter and paragraph spacing, allowing adjustments relative to the element's font size.

Although rem units are already used to make the typography responsive and scalable, the design system is tested to ensure it supports resizing up to 200% without breaking the layout, in accordance with WCAG 2.1 guidelines. This ensures readability for users with low vision, who may rely on browser zoom functionality.

A testing process will be implemented to verify that the design holds up when resized by 200%. Any adjustments will be incorporated into the overall system.

#### Automatic Settings for Variable Fonts

For variable fonts such as Roboto Flex and Roboto Serif, automatic settings adjust key typographic properties such as weight, width, and optical sizing. These properties are dynamically managed based on the context and screen size, allowing the typography to scale naturally across devices. The system utilizes these automatic settings at each hierarchy level, ensuring consistent and responsive typography without manual intervention.

For legacy fonts such as the standard Roboto, the system includes predefined values for variables like font weight and letter spacing. These are documented at each hierarchy level to ensure consistent presentation in environments where variable fonts are not supported.

### 2.3.3 Text Decoration and Transformation

#### Text Transformation:

No text transformations (uppercase, lowercase, capitalization) will be used within the design system to maintain consistent readability and avoid disrupting the natural flow of text, especially for users reliant on assistive technologies.

#### Text Decoration:

While text decoration should be minimized, there are specific cases where it may be used:

* Links: Underlining text to indicate hyperlinks is an acceptable and common practice that aligns with accessibility guidelines. It helps users identify clickable elements without relying solely on color differences【WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.1】.
* Emphasis: Bold or italic styles can be used for emphasis in body text, provided they do not disrupt readability or cause confusion. This should be used sparingly to maintain clarity.
* Visual Styling: Decorative elements like strikethroughs may be used in specific contexts, such as indicating completed tasks or obsolete information, but should be accompanied by appropriate context to ensure that meaning isn’t solely conveyed through decoration.

####

### 2.3.4 Contrast

#### Minimum Contrast

To meet WCAG 2.1 contrast ratio standards, text must be clearly distinguishable from the background to accommodate users with visual impairments. This system adheres to the following minimum contrast ratio requirements:

* Normal Text (Body Medium, Body Large): Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1.
* Large Text (Display D1, D2, Header H1, H2, H3): Minimum contrast ratio of 3:1.

#### Halation Effect

Halation is a visual phenomenon where bright areas bleed into darker areas, creating a glow or halo effect around high-contrast edges. This can reduce readability and cause visual discomfort. Some design experts suggest that contrast ratios above 15:1 can cause discomfort for some users. Aim for a contrast ratio between **7:1 and 15:1** for body text to balance readability and comfort.

### 2.3.5 Assistive Technologies Compatibility

This design system ensures compatibility with assistive technologies, focusing on supporting screen readers, keyboard navigation, and text-to-speech/Braille devices, which are crucial for ensuring accessible typography.

#### Screen Readers

The design system uses proper heading structure and semantic HTML (e.g., \<h1\>, \<h2\>) to maintain a clear hierarchy, ensuring accurate interpretation by screen readers. This allows users to navigate content effectively.

#### Keyboard Navigation

All text links, headings, and interactive elements include clear, visually distinct focus states, supporting users who navigate with a keyboard. This aligns with WCAG 2.1 guidelines, ensuring seamless interaction and accessibility.

#### Text-to-Speech and Braille Devices

Text scaling, line heights, and spacing are designed to be consistent, ensuring accurate interpretation for users relying on text-to-speech and Braille devices​.

### 2.3.6 Text Hierarchy

#### Display D1

Use for the most prominent titles in hero sections, large banners, or landing pages. Ideal for drawing attention to the main content or call-to-action elements.

* Text Size: 5.96rem, 95px in Figma files

## 2.4 Iconography

Icons are core visual elements in the user interface, helping to communicate actions, statuses, and navigational elements. This section provides guidelines for designing, labeling, and integrating icons within the system, ensuring they are accessible, scalable, and adaptable across platforms.

### 2.4.1 Labeling Requirements

All icons are required to have accompanying labels, including icons that are universally recognized, to ensure accessibility for all users. Labels must be placed adjacent to the icon (top, bottom, left, or right) based on the design context.

#### Screen Reader Support:

* ARIA Attributes: The icon and label must be programmatically linked using ARIA attributes. This can be done by either nesting the label and icon within the same container (e.g., a `button` element) or using the `aria-labelledby` attribute to associate the label text with the icon.
* Alt Text and ARIA Label: For functional icons, provide descriptive alt text or an `aria-label` that clearly explains the icon’s purpose. Decorative icons should be marked with `aria-hidden="true"` to be ignored by screen readers.

### 2.4.2 Icon Size and Label Alignment

Icons in this system are designed with a base size of 48px. This size includes the icon image (24px), the Body Medium label (16px), and 8px of padding between the icon and its label. While the base size is designed for default usage, icons must be scalable to accommodate text enlargement requirements up to 96px for accessibility purposes, as per the 200% scaling rule.

* Icon Size: 24px by default, corresponding to 1.5rem.
* Label Size: 16px, corresponding to Body Medium in the typographic hierarchy.
* Padding: 8px between the icon and the label for clarity.

This base size will scale based on rem units, ensuring the icon and label maintain proper proportions even when the user increases font size settings for accessibility. Icons must align vertically and horizontally within this size, maintaining visual harmony with their labels and surrounding content.

### 2.4.3 Icon Groups

Icons in this system are organized into the following primary groups, ensuring clear categorization and consistent use:

1. System Icons: These represent core navigational elements and UI actions (e.g., home, settings, search).
2. Action Icons: Indicate user-triggered actions or commands (e.g., download, delete, edit).
3. Status Icons: Represent conditions or states within the system (e.g., success, warning, error).
4. Agentic Icons: Represent actions or processes related to AI-driven or automated tasks. These icons are designed to communicate agentic behavior or actions that are handled by intelligent systems within the UI.

While this section details the groups, a comprehensive list of icons will be included in the components section, where each icon will be individually detailed.

#### Visual Grouping:

Methods to visually distinguish these groups through using unique geometric backgrounds or visual markers to communicate the icon's category are under exploration and will be refined further.

### 2.4.4 Icon Formats

Icons will be designed and exported in multiple formats to ensure cross-platform compatibility:

* SVG: The default format for web applications due to its scalability and small file size.
* PNG: Provided as a fallback for older browsers or systems that do not support SVG.
* GLB: A 3D format used for web-based AR/VR applications and supported across most platforms, including Android.

### 2.4.5 Naming Conventions and Versioning

Icons must follow a strict naming convention to support multiple brands and projects across the system. The naming convention is structured as:

\[brandname\]*\[category\]*\[action\]\_\[size\]\_v1.0.0

* Brand Name: Represents the brand or project associated with the icon.
* Category: Indicates whether the icon is a status, action, system, or agentic icon.
* Action: Describes the specific function (e.g., download, error, search).
* Size: The icon's size (e.g., 24 for 24px).
* Version: Versioning follows semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0) to track updates and changes.

Example: mybrand\_action\_download\_24\_v1.0.0

### 2.4.6 Accessibility and WCAG Compliance

Icons must meet WCAG 2.1 guidelines to ensure accessibility:

* Contrast Ratios: Icons and their labels must achieve a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text
* Achromatic Design: All icons start in grayscale and are dynamically colored to meet the design context or user settings and should never rely solely on color for meaning
* Text Resizing: Icons and labels must support resizing up to 200% without loss of function or clarity, as required by accessibility standards.

## 2.5 Elevation and Shadow

Elevation and shadow are essential in establishing visual hierarchy, depth, and separation between elements. They guide the user's perception of how elements interact and create a sense of layering, defining the structure of the design.

### 2.5.1 Elevation Levels

Elevation levels represent the distance between an element and the background surface. Higher elevation levels imply greater prominence, while lower levels are closer to the base surface. In this system, elevation levels are denoted with the prefix 'EL' (e.g., EL1, EL2), ensuring clarity and distinguishing them as part of the elevation hierarchy across the design system..

#### Standard Elevation Levels:

* EL1: Minimal elevation, suitable for subtle dividers and hairline borders.
* EL2: Slight elevation for small components like input fields or inactive buttons.
* EL3: Ideal for interactive elements such as standard buttons, dropdowns, and cards.
* EL4: Applied to components like modals or highlighted cards that need a moderate level of emphasis.
* EL5: Used for sidebars, toolbars, and elements that must be more prominent.
* EL6: For overlays, pop-ups, and floating action buttons that require the highest emphasis.

#### Component Containment

Each element should have an elevation level that is higher than any elements contained within it. This ensures a clear visual hierarchy, where parent components (e.g., cards, modals) maintain prominence over their contained elements (e.g., buttons, input fields).

#### Elevation Transitions

When an element changes elevation (e.g., hover, focus, or active states), apply smooth transitions with a duration of 200ms. This creates a fluid and responsive user experience, helping users understand the shift in emphasis or interaction state.

### 2.5.2 Shadow Properties

Shadows are critical for conveying elevation levels. They create depth and separation between elements.

#### Shadow Direction:

Maintain a consistent top-left to bottom-right shadow direction.

#### Shadow Color and Accessibility Considerations

The shadow color will be set to \#050505 to ensure it meets the WCAG 3:1 contrast ratio standard against the darkest background color, \#101010. This adjustment guarantees that shadows remain visible and accessible.

#### Shadow Values by Elevation:

| Elevation Level | Key Shadow Opacity | Ambient Shadow Opacity | Blur Radius | Y Offset |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | 0.20 | 0.10 | 1px | 1px |
| 2 | 0.30 | 0.20 | 4px | 2px |
| 3 | 0.40 | 0.30 | 8px | 3px |
| 4 | 0.50 | 0.40 | 12px | 4px |
| 5 | 0.60 | 0.50 | 12px | 4px |
| 6 | 0.70 | 0.60 | 12px | 4px |

## 2.6 Imagery

The Imagery guidelines establish how images are integrated, optimized, and made accessible within the design system, ensuring visual quality, performance, and compliance with accessibility standards.

##

### 2.6.1 Image Resolutions and Scaling

All images must be provided in three resolutions: 1x, 2x, and 3x of their original width, using the WebP format with lossless compression. The WebP format is preferred for its efficient compression capabilities, maintaining high image quality with smaller file sizes, making it suitable for web usage without compromising visual fidelity.

To maintain aspect ratio and prevent distortion, images will utilize the object-fit: cover property. This ensures that images fill their containers while adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and grid layouts, preserving the intended design.

##

### 2.6.2 Image Download and Metadata

Images displayed on the site will be in the WebP format. However, they may be downloadable in PNG format to accommodate user preferences and compatibility with different software, as WebP is not universally supported across all platforms. This decision is based on the fact that many users still expect PNGs due to their familiarity and broad acceptance in design workflows. Offering downloads in PNG ensures broader usability without compromising the website's performance benefits from WebP.

Regarding AI-generated images, the accompanying text file, often known as the "prompt metadata" or simply "prompt data," should be available for download alongside the image. This file contains the generation parameters, text prompts, and settings used during image creation, providing valuable context for users who may wish to understand or reproduce similar results.

### 2.6.3 Accessibility and ARIA Integration

All images must be accompanied by meaningful alt text that accurately describes the image's content and purpose. This ensures that screen readers convey relevant information to users with visual impairments, making the content accessible. For purely decorative images, use an empty alt="" attribute to signal to screen readers that the image is not essential for understanding the content, preventing unnecessary interruptions.

When additional context is necessary, consider using the following ARIA attributes:

* aria-labelledby: Use this attribute to reference another element's id that serves as a label for the image. This is particularly useful when there is a caption or heading that provides context to the image. It ensures that screen readers present both the image and the associated label together for a comprehensive understanding.
* aria-describedby: Apply this attribute when an image requires a more detailed explanation than the alt text can provide. Link it to another element containing a fuller description or additional context, such as a more comprehensive explanation of a complex chart or diagram.

These attributes enhance accessibility by ensuring that images are fully understood in their intended context, meeting WCAG standards and supporting a wide range of assistive technologies.
