# Phase-6C Full GPU Run â€” Relation Heuristic (mapped)
_Generated:_ 2025-09-02T00:06:50Z

- dev: P=0.500, R=1.000, F1=0.667, support=1
- test: P=0.500, R=1.000, F1=0.667, support=1
- train: P=0.500, R=1.000, F1=0.667, support=1

Notes:
- Mapping learned from train split only; deterministic, receipt-driven.
- GPU info recorded under docs/audit/hardware if available.
