# Phase 7D — Competitive Positioning

## Deterministic Governance Advantage
- **Fail-closed by construction**: tri-state + strict DENY precedence ensures no silent leakage.
- **Sub-µs reasoning overhead**: fast-path explanations + perf harness protect latency.
- **Provable invariance**: enrichment is additive; gating decisions unchanged under REASONING_ENABLE.

## Method Enabling Community Verification
- Ship receipts (`docs/audit/*`) + evidence bundle (`docs/evidence/phase7d/*`).
- Re-run tests with `REASONING_ENABLE=1` via `ci/run_7c_with_reasoning.sh`.

## Contrast vs. Training-Based Alignment
- No gradient-based fine-tuning required to enforce constraints.
- Evidence-centric audit trail vs. latent alignment signals.

## What We Prove (and What We Don’t)
- Prove: decision-path determinism, fail-closed gating, additive enrichment.
- Don’t claim: semantic comprehension beyond constraints or SOTA on general tasks.

## Next Additions
- Public demo pack with redacted enriched audits (non-sensitive).
