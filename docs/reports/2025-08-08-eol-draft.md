Title: End-of-Log Draft — RNL Theory + Merge-triggered Reporting
Shipped
- RNL theory and use-case doc (human-first with light relational hints).
- RNL glossary anchors for consistency.
- CI workflow that posts an END_OF_LOG comment on PR merge.

Benefits
- Teaches graph thinking by usage; reduces ambiguity in agent<>human comms.
- Creates automatic, plain-text END_OF_LOG reports tied to PR merges.
- Sets stage for later auto-translation to queries.

Next
- Add RNL hint level toggles to config (RNL_HINTS).
- Instrument pre-lint to enforce control-token safety.
- Begin examples library (before→after) for common DB narratives.
