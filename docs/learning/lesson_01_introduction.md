# Lesson 1 â€” What is Open-DARF (Peer Validator Path)

Open-DARF helps you (a peer) prove a system is working on **your** machine and collect **evidence**.

**Key ideas**
- *Human-in-the-loop*: you run commands; the system shows heartbeats every ~2s.
- *Receipts*: JSON/archives written to `results/` tell the story of what happened.
- *Windows-first*: we prioritize PowerShell friendliness, but Linux/WSL works too.

**Try it**
~~~bash
bash ./scripts/run.sh
~~~
