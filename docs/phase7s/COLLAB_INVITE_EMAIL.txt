Subject: Open-DARF mini-validation (Phase 7S) — 10–15 min run

Hi,

Could you run a quick validation on a native Ubuntu 22.04 + RTX 30/40 machine?

Steps:
1) Unpack the attached Open-DARF minimal archive.
2) cd open-darf
3) ./install.sh
4) ./validate/run_minimal.sh
5) ./validate/generate_evidence.sh
   (or: make oneclick)

Please send back the generated open-darf-report-<HOST>-<TS>.tar.gz and any JSON receipt.
If anything fails, send console output; TROUBLESHOOTING.md is included.

Thanks!
