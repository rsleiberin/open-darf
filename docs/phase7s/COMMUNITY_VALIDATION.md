# Community Validation Campaign (Phase 7S)

Goal: independent confirmations of validator/evidence on diverse hardware.

What to run (native Ubuntu 22.04 + RTX 30/40 recommended):
- Run: ./install.sh
- Run: ./validate/run_minimal.sh
- Run: ./validate/generate_evidence.sh
- Send us the resulting evidence tarball and (optional) your JSON receipt.

What to include in your message:
- GPU model and VRAM size
- NVIDIA driver version
- OS version and kernel
- Approximate run time and any errors seen

We maintain an intake process that preserves your evidence and emits a receipt.
