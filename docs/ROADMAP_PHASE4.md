# Phase 4 — Roadmap (Kickoff)

## Goals
- Complete Phase-3 → Phase-4 migration.
- Enforce label families and opt-in perf gate.
- Seed ML integration planning (SciBERT, BioBERT, Text2NKG, Graph-State LSTM).

## Current Status
- Labels/templates complete; noncompliance = 0.
- Perf workflow present (RUN_PERF=1 gate).
- Phase-4 planning issues opened (#304–#307).

## Near-Term
- Implement eval harness; add benchmarks behind RUN_PERF=1.
- Track progress in issues; keep docs/admin PRs status-only.
