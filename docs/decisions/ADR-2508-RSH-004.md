## Context
The brief provides a high-level overview of Janus’s backend design goals, constraints, and technology shortlist, intended for new contributors.

## Research Question
**Primary:** What architectural principles and component choices define the Janus backend?  
**Secondary:** Which constraints (offline capability, single-developer ops) shape vendor selection?

## Methodology
Desk review of the 18-page onboarding brief; cross-checked references to vendor docs and internal ADRs.

## Findings (concise)
* Emphasises **local-first, cloud-optional** deployment.
* Favors **PostgreSQL + Neo4j + Qdrant** for heterogeneous data.
* Containers via **Podman** for rootless edge environments.
* Workflow tooling unified under **Turborepo**.

## Decision Rationale
Chosen as the canonical architectural snapshot that downstream ADRs must align with; supersedes scattered wiki notes.

## Implementation Implications
* All future CON/VEN ADRs should cite this RSH to ensure architectural cohesion.
* Onboarding docs link directly to this ADR.

## Reevaluation Triggers
* Major shift in deployment model (e.g., SaaS-only).  
* Adoption of alternative database trio.
