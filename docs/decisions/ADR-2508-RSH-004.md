## Context
“Janus Backend Architecture – Onboarding Brief” (18 pp) is handed to new
contributors as the single source of truth for high-level backend design goals,
constraints, and preferred technologies.

## Research Question
**Primary :** What architectural principles and component choices define the
Janus backend at MVP scope?  
**Secondary :** How do offline-first requirements and solo-developer operations
shape vendor selection?

## Methodology
* Desk review of the PDF (v1.2, 2025-08-01).  
* Cross-checked references to existing CON / VEN ADRs.  
* No additional experimentation; findings are qualitative.

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Deployment model fitness** – cloud-optional, edge capable.  
2. **Ops simplicity** – tooling a single developer can run.  
3. **Data heterogeneity** – documents, graphs, vectors side-by-side.  
4. **License / cost** – FOSS-first, low recurring fees.

## Findings
| Aspect | Key Points | Impact |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Data stores | PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Qdrant tri-store | Enables polyglot persistence without SaaS lock-in |
| Containers | Rootless **Podman** | Aligns with edge/offline nodes where Docker daemon isn’t available |
| Orchestration | **Turborepo** for mono-repo workflows | Simplifies CI/CD with incremental builds |
| Ops | **Systemd-nspawn** units + Ansible | No Kubernetes overhead for single-node deployments |

The brief emphasises *local-first, cloud-optional* architecture; all downstream
decisions inherit this bias.

## Decision Rationale
Chosen as the canonical architectural snapshot. It supersedes scattered wiki
pages and ensures that every new ADR aligns with the same baseline.

## Implementation Implications
* **CON ADRs** should cite this RSH when they derive requirements (e.g.,
  storage, messaging).  
* **VEN ADRs** must demonstrate compatibility with at least two of the
  evaluation criteria above.  
* Onboarding docs link directly to this ADR instead of the PDF.

## Reevaluation Triggers
* Switch to a Kubernetes-centric deployment model.  
* Adoption of a managed cloud database set replacing the tri-store.  
* Team size grows beyond “solo developer” operations.
