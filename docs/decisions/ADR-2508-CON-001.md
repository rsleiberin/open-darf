## Context

This ADR defines vendor-agnostic requirements for vector storage capabilities in our Python-based AI stack. These requirements emerged from comprehensive research into vector database options and address the need for semantic search capabilities in LLM applications while maintaining flexibility for uncertain dataset sizes and deployment constraints.

## Problem Statement

**Core Need**: High-performance vector similarity search with metadata filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows

**Constraints**: 
- Python backend integration requirement
- Uncertain scale requirements (prototype to production)
- Potential need for offline/local deployment
- Budget considerations for long-term scaling

**Context**: Vector storage is essential for AI applications requiring dynamic context retrieval, semantic search through document repositories, and knowledge base enhancement for LLM responses.

## Requirements Definition

### Functional Requirements

1. **Vector Similarity Search**: Support for high-dimensional vector storage and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search with sub-10ms query latency
2. **Metadata Filtering**: Ability to attach and filter by metadata (tags, timestamps, document types) for precise query results
3. **Hybrid Search Capabilities**: Combination of vector similarity with keyword-based search and structured filters
4. **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk vector insertion, updates, and deletion for data pipeline integration
5. **Multi-Modal Support**: Storage and search across different embedding types (text, image, document)

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: 
   - Query latency: <10ms for similarity search
   - Throughput: Support for concurrent queries without degradation
   - Indexing: Efficient HNSW or equivalent indexing for fast ANN searches

2. **Reliability**: 
   - Data persistence and durability
   - Graceful handling of node failures
   - Backup and recovery capabilities

3. **Security**: 
   - Authentication and authorization controls
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Multi-tenant data isolation capabilities

4. **Operability**: 
   - Health monitoring and metrics collection
   - Resource usage visibility (memory, CPU, storage)
   - Clear deployment and scaling procedures

5. **Compatibility**: 
   - Native Python client library with clean API
   - REST API for language-agnostic access
   - Integration with common Python ML/AI frameworks

### Quality Attributes

- **Scalability**: Handle growth from thousands to millions of vectors without architectural changes
- **Maintainability**: Clear configuration, logging, and operational procedures
- **Extensibility**: Support for new embedding models and vector dimensions
- **Portability**: Deployment flexibility across local, cloud, and hybrid environments

## Architectural Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Python Integration**: Must provide well-maintained Python client with minimal friction
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimal RAM usage for vector indices with large datasets
- **Storage Flexibility**: Support for both in-memory and persistent storage options

### Business Constraints
- **Cost Optimization**: Prefer solutions that scale cost-effectively with usage
- **Vendor Independence**: Avoid lock-in to proprietary formats or APIs
- **Timeline**: Must enable rapid prototyping while supporting production scaling

### Operational Constraints
- **Self-Hosting Capability**: Option to deploy and manage internally for data sovereignty
- **Resource Requirements**: Reasonable hardware requirements for development and small-scale deployment
- **Skill Requirements**: Operational complexity appropriate for solo developer to small team

## Success Criteria

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Integration Success**: Python application can store, retrieve, and search vectors with <5 lines of code
2. **Performance Validation**: Similarity search completes in <10ms for datasets up to 1M vectors
3. **Metadata Filtering**: Complex queries combining vector similarity with multiple metadata conditions execute efficiently
4. **Scaling Verification**: System handles 10x data growth without performance degradation

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Query Latency**: 95th percentile <10ms for similarity search
- **Throughput**: >1000 queries per second on standard hardware
- **Memory Efficiency**: <2GB RAM for 100K 768-dimensional vectors
- **Storage Efficiency**: Compression ratio >50% for typical document embeddings

## Implementation Guidance

### Vendor Selection Criteria
1. **Python Ecosystem Integration**: Quality of Python client, documentation, and community support
2. **Performance Characteristics**: Benchmarked query latency and throughput on representative workloads
3. **Deployment Flexibility**: Support for local development, self-hosted production, and managed service options
4. **Feature Completeness**: Metadata filtering, hybrid search, and operational monitoring capabilities
5. **Community and Support**: Active development, production usage examples, and support channels

### Integration Patterns
- **Embedding Pipeline**: Async batch insertion for large document processing
- **Query Interface**: Unified API for similarity search with optional metadata filters
- **Caching Layer**: Optional Redis integration for frequently accessed vector results
- **Monitoring Integration**: Metrics export for performance tracking and alerting

### Deployment Considerations
- **Development Setup**: Docker container for local development with minimal configuration
- **Production Deployment**: Scalable architecture supporting single-node to distributed configurations
- **Resource Planning**: Memory and storage sizing guidelines for different vector collection sizes
- **Backup Strategy**: Vector data export/import capabilities for disaster recovery

## Related Decisions

**Research Basis:**
- ADR-2508-RSH-001: Comprehensive analysis of vector database options that identified these requirements

**Implementations:**
- ADR-2508-VEN-007: Qdrant selection that implements these vector storage requirements

**Dependencies:**
- Future CON ADRs for hybrid storage architecture and multi-tenant security requirements

## Evolution Path

### Anticipated Changes
- **Scale Growth**: Requirements may evolve from single-node to distributed architecture
- **Feature Expansion**: Additional requirements for multi-modal search and advanced analytics
- **Performance Optimization**: Stricter latency requirements as user base grows

### Migration Strategy
- **Vendor Transition**: Vector export/import capabilities enable switching between implementations
- **Schema Evolution**: Metadata schema changes must be backward compatible
- **Performance Scaling**: Clear upgrade path from development to production configurations

## Reevaluation Triggers

- **Scale Threshold**: Vector collection exceeds 10 million embeddings
- **Performance Degradation**: Query latency consistently exceeds 10ms
- **Feature Gaps**: Required capabilities not supported by current implementation
- **Cost Optimization**: Operational costs become disproportionate to business value
- **Technology Evolution**: New vector database paradigms offer significant advantages
