# SciERC Entrypoint Discovery â€” Phase 7O

**Context:** No explicit SciERC driver was found earlier. This record captures repository discovery, help-preflight results, and upgrades the full-run harness to auto-discover an entrypoint safely.

- Discovery log: `docs/audit/phase7o/receipts/scierc_discovery_20250912_022442.log`
- Harness: `scripts/phase7o/run_scierc_full.sh`
- Policy: Do not execute heavy GPU jobs unless operator issues **GO full run**.

**Status:** Ready to launch full evaluation once operator approves.
