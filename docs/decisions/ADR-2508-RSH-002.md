# ADR-2508-RSH-002: Backend Architecture Analysis for Generative AI Platform


## Context

This research analyzes backend architecture considerations specifically for generative AI platforms, examining the unique requirements that AI workloads place on data storage, retrieval, and security systems. The analysis addresses four critical architectural decisions: data storage strategy, hybrid cloud integration, vector search capabilities, and multi-tenant security isolation.

## Research Question

**Primary**: What backend architectural patterns best support generative AI platforms with requirements for diverse data types, hybrid storage, semantic search, and secure multi-tenant operation?

**Secondary**: How do traditional database architectures need to be augmented or replaced to handle AI-specific workloads like large JSON documents, embeddings, and dynamic context retrieval?

## Methodology

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Data Handling Capability**: Support for structured, semi-structured, and vector data
2. **Storage Flexibility**: Local-first with cloud scalability options
3. **AI Workload Optimization**: Performance for large documents and embeddings
4. **Security Architecture**: Multi-tenant isolation and AI agent sandboxing
5. **Scalability**: Growth from prototype to production workloads

### Research Sources
- **Primary**: "Backend Architecture Considerations for a Generative AI Platform" (7 pages)
- **Secondary**: AWS documentation, vector database comparisons, multi-tenant security patterns
- **Practical**: Analysis of RAG workflow requirements and AI agent security models

## Findings

### Data Storage Architecture Analysis

#### Hybrid Database Approach (Recommended)
**Use Case**: Generative AI applications require handling diverse data types from structured user accounts to large JSON documents containing AI outputs, conversation logs, and training data.

**Architectural Pattern**:
- **Relational Database (PostgreSQL)**: Structured data (user accounts, configurations, small metadata)
- **Document Database**: Semi-structured data (LLM outputs, conversation logs, training examples)
- **Rationale**: Traditional RDBMS excel at structured records but struggle with large JSON objects, requiring "off-row" storage that creates performance overhead

**Performance Analysis**:
- RDBMS JSON storage becomes inefficient for kilobyte/megabyte documents common in AI workflows
- Document databases optimize for variable-size documents without serialization overhead
- Specialized storage engines handle document ranges from bytes to megabytes efficiently

#### Storage Tier Strategy

**Local-First with Cloud Backup**:
- **Active Data**: Fast local storage for frequently accessed AI context and real-time operations
- **Archive Data**: S3 cloud storage for historical data, large training datasets, and backups
- **Benefits**: Combines local performance with cloud scalability and durability

**Implementation Pattern**:
- Tiered storage system with automatic data lifecycle management
- Recent/hot data on local high-performance storage
- Cold data migration to S3 for cost-effective long-term retention
- Hybrid approach provides resilience against local hardware failures

### Vector Database Evaluation

#### When Vector Search is Essential
**Primary Use Cases**:
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Finding semantically similar documents to enhance AI responses
- **Knowledge Base Search**: Semantic similarity search through large document repositories
- **Context Retrieval**: Dynamic lookup of relevant information for AI agent decision-making

**Technical Requirements**:
- High-dimensional vector storage and similarity search optimization
- Real-time semantic search capabilities for AI context enhancement
- Integration with embedding generation workflows

#### When Vector Search Can Be Deferred
**Scenarios**:
- Static training data applications without dynamic context needs
- Simple keyword-based search requirements
- Limited data volumes where traditional search suffices
- Early development phases before semantic search requirements emerge

**Decision Framework**:
- **Adopt Early**: If AI agents need real-time knowledge retrieval from large datasets
- **Defer**: If application focuses on model training or generation without dynamic context lookup
- **Complexity Consideration**: Vector databases add architectural complexity and require embedding management expertise

### Security Architecture for AI Systems

#### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
**Core Principle**: Least privilege access with strict context boundaries to prevent data leakage between tenants, users, or AI agent sessions.

**Implementation Strategies**:

**Tenant-Scoped Storage**:
- Row-level security with TenantID filtering on all queries
- Database-level isolation for physical data separation
- Prevents cross-tenant data access even with malicious queries

**Session Isolation**:
- Unique context identifiers for each AI agent session
- Memory purging between sessions to prevent context carryover
- Strict session boundary enforcement in AI agent memory systems

**Agent Permission Sandboxing**:
- Restricted role assignments for AI agents with minimal necessary permissions
- API endpoint limitations to prevent unauthorized data access
- Output monitoring to detect and prevent data leakage

#### AI-Specific Security Considerations

**Prompt Injection Prevention**:
- Input sanitization to prevent malicious prompt manipulation
- Context isolation to limit AI agent data access scope
- Output filtering to detect potential data leakage attempts

**Audit and Monitoring**:
- Comprehensive logging of AI agent data access patterns
- Real-time monitoring for anomalous data retrieval behavior
- Compliance tracking for regulatory requirements

### Quantitative Analysis

| Architecture Component | Traditional Approach | AI-Optimized Approach | Performance Impact |
|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| JSON Document Storage | RDBMS JSONB | Document Database | 3-5x better for large docs |
| Vector Similarity Search | SQL approximation | Specialized Vector DB | 10-100x faster queries |
| Multi-Tenant Isolation | Application-level | Database-level + Session | Eliminates cross-tenant risk |
| Storage Scalability | Local expansion | Hybrid Local+Cloud | Unlimited growth capability |

## Decision Rationale

**Primary Factors**:
1. **Data Diversity**: AI workloads require specialized storage for different data types (structured, document, vector)
2. **Performance Optimization**: Traditional databases not optimized for large JSON documents and vector similarity
3. **Security Requirements**: AI agents create new attack vectors requiring enhanced isolation
4. **Scalability Needs**: Hybrid storage provides local performance with cloud scalability

**Secondary Factors**:
- Cost optimization through tiered storage strategy
- Operational complexity balanced against capability requirements
- Future-proofing for evolving AI workload patterns
- Integration flexibility with existing infrastructure

## Implementation Implications

### Architecture Impact
- **Multi-Database Strategy**: Requires coordination between relational, document, and vector databases
- **Hybrid Storage Management**: Automated data lifecycle policies for local-to-cloud migration
- **Security Layer Enhancement**: Additional isolation mechanisms beyond traditional authentication
- **Monitoring Complexity**: Multi-system observability and performance tracking

### Operational Benefits
- **Performance Optimization**: Right-sized storage for each data type and access pattern
- **Cost Efficiency**: Tiered storage reduces total cost while maintaining performance
- **Security Enhancement**: Proactive isolation prevents AI-specific security vulnerabilities
- **Scalability Enablement**: Hybrid approach supports growth without architectural redesign

### Development Experience
- **Data Access Patterns**: Clear separation of concerns for different data types
- **AI Integration**: Optimized pathways for AI agent data access and context management
- **Security Implementation**: Built-in isolation mechanisms reduce security implementation burden
- **Operational Simplicity**: Automated data management reduces manual intervention needs
