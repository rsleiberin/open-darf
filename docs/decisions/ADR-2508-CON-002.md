## Context

This ADR defines vendor-agnostic requirements for a hybrid storage architecture that supports generative AI platform needs. The requirements address the challenge of handling diverse data types (structured records, large JSON documents, embeddings, training data) while maintaining local-first performance with cloud scalability and backup capabilities.

## Problem Statement

**Core Need**: Flexible storage architecture that handles both structured and semi-structured data while providing local performance with cloud backup and scalability

**Constraints**: 
- Generative AI applications produce varied data types and sizes (KB to MB documents)
- Need for local control and low latency for active workloads
- Requirement for unlimited scalability and disaster recovery
- Cost optimization for long-term data retention

**Context**: AI platforms generate large, variable-size JSON documents, conversation logs, embeddings, and training data that challenge traditional single-database approaches while requiring both performance and durability.

## Requirements Definition

### Functional Requirements

1. **Multi-Database Architecture**: Support for both relational and document storage to optimize for different data types and access patterns
2. **Tiered Storage Management**: Automatic data lifecycle policies for moving cold data from local to cloud storage
3. **Local-First Operations**: Primary operations execute against local storage for optimal performance
4. **Cloud Backup Integration**: Seamless backup and archival to cloud object storage (S3-compatible)
5. **Data Type Optimization**: Efficient storage for structured records, large JSON documents, and binary objects

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: 
   - Local storage latency: <1ms for structured queries
   - Document retrieval: <10ms for JSON documents up to 10MB
   - Tiered access: <100ms for cloud-backed data retrieval

2. **Reliability**: 
   - Local data durability: 99.9% availability
   - Cloud backup durability: 99.999999999% (11 9's)
   - Automatic failover to cloud storage if local storage fails

3. **Security**: 
   - Encryption at rest for both local and cloud storage
   - Encryption in transit for all data movement
   - Access control integration across storage tiers

4. **Operability**: 
   - Automated data lifecycle management
   - Storage usage monitoring and alerting
   - Backup verification and recovery testing capabilities

5. **Compatibility**: 
   - Standard SQL interface for structured data
   - Document query capabilities for semi-structured data
   - S3-compatible API for object storage

### Quality Attributes

- **Scalability**: Support growth from GB to TB scale without architectural changes
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between storage types and tiers
- **Extensibility**: Ability to add new storage tiers or data types
- **Portability**: Cloud-agnostic design with multiple S3-compatible provider support

## Architectural Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Data Type Optimization**: Relational storage for structured data, document storage for large JSON objects
- **Storage Efficiency**: Minimize "off-row" storage overhead in relational systems for large documents
- **Network Dependency**: Cloud tier accessible but system functional if network unavailable

### Business Constraints
- **Cost Management**: Automated tiering to optimize storage costs over time
- **Data Sovereignty**: Local storage for sensitive data with selective cloud archival
- **Compliance**: Support for data retention policies and geographical storage requirements

### Operational Constraints
- **Resource Planning**: Predictable local storage growth patterns with cloud overflow
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated, verifiable backup processes with point-in-time recovery
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive visibility into storage usage, performance, and costs

## Success Criteria

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Storage Separation**: Applications can efficiently store structured data in relational format and large documents in document format
2. **Automatic Tiering**: Data automatically moves from local to cloud storage based on age and access patterns
3. **Performance Validation**: Active data queries complete within local storage latency requirements
4. **Backup Verification**: Cloud backup and recovery processes complete successfully within RTO/RPO targets

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Local Operations**: 95th percentile <1ms for structured queries, <10ms for document queries
- **Tiering Efficiency**: Cold data transfer to cloud completes within 24 hours
- **Recovery Performance**: Point-in-time recovery from cloud backup completes within 4 hours
- **Storage Efficiency**: Document storage shows >3x better performance than relational JSON storage for large objects

## Implementation Guidance

### Data Classification Strategy
1. **Structured Data**: User accounts, configurations, metadata → Relational storage
2. **Semi-Structured Data**: LLM outputs, conversation logs, training examples → Document storage  
3. **Binary Objects**: Large files, embeddings, media → Object storage
4. **Archive Data**: Historical records, compliance data → Cloud storage

### Tiering Policies
- **Hot Data (Local)**: Recent data accessed within 30 days
- **Warm Data (Local Cache + Cloud)**: Data accessed within 90 days, cached locally when accessed
- **Cold Data (Cloud Only)**: Data older than 90 days, retrieved on-demand

### Integration Patterns
- **Application Layer**: Database abstraction layer handling storage type selection
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated ETL processes for tiering and archival
- **Backup Workflows**: Continuous backup with incremental cloud synchronization
- **Recovery Procedures**: Automated local restoration from cloud archives

### Deployment Considerations
- **Local Storage**: High-performance SSD for active data with appropriate RAID configuration
- **Cloud Integration**: S3-compatible object storage with lifecycle policies
- **Network Resilience**: Local operations continue during cloud connectivity issues
- **Monitoring Integration**: Storage metrics collection and alerting for capacity and performance

## Related Decisions

**Research Basis:**
- ADR-2508-RSH-002: Backend architecture analysis identifying hybrid storage needs

**Implementations:**
- ADR-2508-VEN-006: PostgreSQL selection for structured data storage
- ADR-2508-VEN-008: MinIO selection for S3-compatible object storage

**Dependencies:**
- Future SEC ADR for encryption and access control across storage tiers
- Future ARC ADR for data layer architecture coordinating multiple storage systems

## Evolution Path

### Anticipated Changes
- **Scale Requirements**: Growth from single-node to distributed storage architecture
- **Data Types**: Additional requirements for specialized storage (time-series, graph data)
- **Compliance**: Enhanced data governance and regulatory requirements

### Migration Strategy
- **Gradual Implementation**: Start with single storage type, add tiers incrementally
- **Data Portability**: Standard formats and APIs enable migration between storage providers
- **Capacity Planning**: Clear metrics for when to scale each storage tier

## Reevaluation Triggers

- **Storage Capacity**: Local storage utilization exceeds 80% consistently
- **Performance Degradation**: Query latency exceeds acceptable thresholds
- **Cost Optimization**: Cloud storage costs become disproportionate to local alternatives
- **Compliance Changes**: New data residency or retention requirements
- **Technology Evolution**: New storage paradigms offer significant advantages
