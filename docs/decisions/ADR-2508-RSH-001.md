## Context

This research ADR evaluates vector database options for a Python-based AI stack, specifically for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications requiring high-performance semantic search, offline capability, and ARM-friendly deployment.

## Research Question

**Primary**: Which vector database best balances performance, operational simplicity, and offline deployment requirements for a Python-based RAG system?

**Secondary**: How do vector databases compare across dimensions of memory efficiency, query performance, ecosystem integration, and ARM compatibility?

## Methodology

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Performance**: Query latency, throughput, memory efficiency
2. **Operational Complexity**: Deployment, maintenance, scaling requirements  
3. **Ecosystem Integration**: Python library quality, framework compatibility
4. **Hardware Requirements**: ARM compatibility, resource footprint
5. **Offline Capability**: Embedded mode, air-gapped deployment support
6. **Feature Completeness**: Filtering, metadata support, hybrid search

### Research Sources
- **Primary**: "Best Vector Database Options for a Python-Based AI Stack" (26 pages)
- **Secondary**: Vendor documentation, benchmark studies, community feedback
- **Practical**: Local testing with representative workloads

## Findings

### Option Analysis

#### Qdrant (Selected)
**Strengths:**
- Rust-based core provides excellent performance with low memory footprint
- Native embedded mode enables offline deployment without service dependencies
- Comprehensive filtering capabilities with payload metadata support
- Strong Python client library with async support
- ARM64 compatibility confirmed
- Single binary deployment simplifies operations

**Weaknesses:**
- Smaller ecosystem compared to established players
- Limited distributed clustering options in open-source version
- Documentation gaps for advanced use cases

**Performance Profile:**
- Query latency: <10ms for datasets up to 10M vectors
- Memory efficiency: ~4-6 bytes per dimension per vector
- Concurrent throughput: 1000+ QPS on standard hardware

#### Weaviate (Rejected)
**Strengths:**
- Rich feature set with built-in ML models
- GraphQL API provides flexible querying
- Strong community and enterprise support

**Weaknesses:**
- Higher operational complexity (multiple services, dependencies)
- Significant memory overhead (~20-30% higher than Qdrant)
- Limited offline deployment options
- ARM support present but less optimized

#### Milvus (Rejected)
**Strengths:**
- Excellent performance at scale (>100M vectors)
- Rich ecosystem and enterprise backing
- Advanced indexing algorithms (HNSW, IVF, etc.)

**Weaknesses:**
- Complex multi-service architecture (coordinator, proxy, data nodes)
- High operational overhead for small-to-medium deployments
- Resource requirements exceed target ARM environment capabilities
- Offline deployment requires significant infrastructure

#### pgvector (Rejected)
**Strengths:**
- Leverages existing PostgreSQL infrastructure
- Familiar SQL interface for queries
- Excellent for hybrid relational + vector workloads
- Minimal operational overhead

**Weaknesses:**
- Performance limitations at scale (>1M vectors)
- Limited indexing options compared to specialized solutions
- Memory efficiency lower than purpose-built vector databases
- Query expressiveness limited by SQL constraints

#### ChromaDB (Rejected)
**Strengths:**
- Simple Python-first API
- Excellent for prototyping and development
- Embedded mode with minimal setup

**Weaknesses:**
- Performance limitations in production workloads
- Limited filtering and metadata capabilities
- Less mature ecosystem for production deployment
- Scalability concerns for multi-user scenarios

### Quantitative Comparison

| Database | Query Latency (ms) | Memory Efficiency | ARM Support | Offline Mode | Ops Complexity |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Qdrant   | <10               | Excellent        | Native      | Full         | Low            |
| Weaviate | 15-25             | Good             | Limited     | Partial      | Medium         |
| Milvus   | <5                | Excellent        | Basic       | Complex      | High           |
| pgvector | 20-50             | Fair             | Native      | Full         | Low            |
| ChromaDB | 25-100            | Fair             | Native      | Full         | Low            |

## Decision Rationale

**Primary Factors:**
1. **Offline Deployment**: Qdrant's embedded mode eliminates service dependencies critical for off-grid operation
2. **Performance vs Complexity**: Best balance of query performance with operational simplicity
3. **ARM Compatibility**: Native ARM64 support with optimized performance characteristics
4. **Python Ecosystem**: High-quality async client library with comprehensive feature support

**Secondary Factors:**
- Memory efficiency supports resource-constrained environments
- Single binary deployment reduces attack surface and maintenance burden
- Filtering capabilities enable complex RAG retrieval patterns
- Growing ecosystem indicates sustainable long-term choice

## Implementation Implications

### Architecture Impact
- Enables embedded vector search without external service dependencies
- Supports both in-memory and persistent storage modes
- Allows for horizontal scaling when requirements grow
- Integrates cleanly with existing Python/PostgreSQL stack

### Operational Benefits
- Single binary deployment via Docker or native installation
- Configuration via simple YAML files
- Built-in monitoring and metrics endpoints
- Backup/restore through standard filesystem operations

### Development Experience
- Async Python client enables high-performance integrations
- Comprehensive API covering CRUD, search, and administration
- Local development identical to production deployment
- Clear migration path from other vector databases

## Reevaluation Triggers

- Vector dataset size exceeds 100M embeddings
- Query latency requirements drop below 5ms consistently
- Distributed deployment becomes necessary
- Advanced ML features (auto-embedding, reranking) become critical
- ARM performance becomes insufficient for workload
