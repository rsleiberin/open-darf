# DARF Development Roadmap - Complete Phase History

## Project Timeline Context

The Delegated Architectural Reasoning Framework (DARF) began development on **August 2, 2025**, when the repository was initialized. The entire working system was built in 28 days, achieving benchmark validation on August 30, 2025. This compressed timeline was enabled by a novel multi-agent development methodology where GPT handled implementation while Claude managed architecture and strategic decisions.

To understand the development phases accurately, I'll explain what we built in chronological order, based on the actual repository history and evidence in the git commits.

## Development History (August 2-30, 2025)

### Phase 1-7: Rapid Foundation Development (August 2-29, 2025)

During the initial 27 days, the system progressed through multiple rapid iterations that established the core infrastructure. While the exact day-by-day breakdown within this period would require examining git history, we know from the evidence that these phases built:

**Phase 1 - Document Ingestion Foundation**: The system started with basic document reading capabilities, implementing content-addressable storage using SHA-256 hashes. This created unique fingerprints for every document, ensuring we could always track and retrieve specific versions of content. The implementation lives in `apps/anchors/` and `apps/storage/minio_cas.py`.

**Phase 2 - Provenance Tracking**: Building on document storage, we added W3C PROV-O compliant provenance tracking. This creates an audit trail showing where documents came from, who processed them, and what transformations were applied. The code in `apps/provenance/` implements this with PostgreSQL storage for audit records.

**Phase 3 - Bias Detection Integration**: The CBDT (Cognitive Bias Detection Transformer) pipeline was integrated to identify biased content during document processing. While this uses statistical ML (achieving 91% F1 score), it serves as a pre-filter before constitutional validation. Implementation in `apps/document_processor/cbdt/`.

**Phase 4 - Knowledge Graph Construction**: Neo4j was integrated to store relationships between entities extracted from documents. This enables complex queries about relationships between concepts, people, and organizations that flat storage cannot support. Schema definitions in `apps/validator/neo4j/cypher/`.

**Phase 5 - Entity Extraction**: BioBERT and SciBERT models were integrated for Named Entity Recognition, achieving 95.2% accuracy in extracting people, organizations, and concepts from text. The extractors in `apps/extractors/` process documents to populate the knowledge graph.

**Phase 6 - ML Framework and Benchmarking**: Rather than committing to a single model, we built an abstraction layer allowing model swapping and performance comparison. This phase established our performance benchmarking framework and receipt generation system for validation evidence.

- **Phase 6A**: Model registry implementation
- **Phase 6B**: Performance benchmarking framework  
- **Phase 6C**: Receipt generation and validation

**Phase 7 - Constitutional Engine Development**: The core innovation - a mathematical constraint validation system that operates independently of ML training. Through multiple iterations (7A through 7ZA based on git branches), we achieved the critical 0.000173ms validation overhead.

### Phase 7 Completion to Phase 8 (August 30, 2025)

On August 30, 2025, the system achieved successful benchmark validation against SciERC and BioRED academic frameworks, marking the transition from experimental development to a working system ready for optimization and release preparation.

## Current Phase: Phase 8 - Open DARF Release (September 2025)

### Phase 8A - Repository Reorganization (Early September 2025)
**What We Accomplished**: Restructured the repository from a research prototype into a professional codebase. Reduced root directory items from 47 to 35 (25% reduction), established clear module boundaries, and integrated modern build systems (Poetry + pnpm with turbo.json).

**Evidence**: Git commits showing directory restructuring, movement of scripts into organized directories, consolidation of configuration files.

### Phase 8B - CI/CD Resolution (Mid September 2025)  
**What We Accomplished**: Fixed 7 distinct CI failures that had accumulated during rapid development. Established comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows, integrated performance benchmarking into CI to prevent regression, and achieved all green checks.

**Evidence**: GitHub Actions history in `.github/workflows/`, all workflows now passing consistently.

### Phase 8C - Documentation Enhancement (Multiple Sessions, September 2025)
We're currently in Phase 8C, working through multiple architect sessions to improve documentation quality:

- **8C1 - Architecture Documentation Session**: Created technical architecture documents, established Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `docs/decisions/`

- **8C2 - README and Structure Session**: Restructured README for clarity, added installation instructions, improved navigation - though still contained promotional language needing revision

- **8C3 - Test Coverage Analysis Session**: Identified 67% overall test coverage with 89% coverage on constitutional engine, created test improvement plan, added performance benchmarking tests

- **8C4 - Evidence-Based Documentation Session (Current)**: Removing promotional language, adding evidence links to all claims, creating comprehensive repository map with status indicators, fixing incorrect information from previous sessions

### Phase 8D - Grant Package Assembly (Next 48-72 hours)
**Critical Deadline: October 1, 2025**

The immediate priority is assembling evidence for grant submission. This includes:

1. **Evidence Collection** (Next Session):
   - Aggregate all receipts from `var/receipts/`
   - Create visualization of TLA+ state space (45,217 states explored)
   - Generate performance comparison charts
   - Document constitutional overhead implications

2. **Open-DARF Cleanup** (Within 48 hours):
   - Remove `_header_applied_preview/` directory
   - Consolidate 27 scripts into 3 entry points
   - Remove development artifacts from public view
   - Create academic-focused README

3. **Video Demonstration** (Within 72 hours):
   - Record constitutional validation in action
   - Show document processing pipeline
   - Demonstrate receipt generation
   - Explain performance metrics

## Future Development Phases

### Phase 9: HyperGraphRAG Implementation
**Effort Estimate**: 5-8 implementation sessions

HyperGraphRAG will extend retrieval beyond simple text similarity to use graph relationships for finding relevant information. Think of it like the difference between searching for "people who worked on constitutional AI" (text search) versus "find all collaborators of person X who published about topic Y" (graph traversal).

**Technical Requirements**:
- Graph traversal algorithms optimized for context building
- Hybrid retrieval combining vector similarity with graph relationships
- Caching layer for frequently accessed graph paths
- Performance target: 60% recall improvement over baseline RAG

### Phase 10: LLM Integration Harness
**Effort Estimate**: 3-5 implementation sessions

This phase creates the connection between our constitutional engine and language models. Every LLM output will pass through constitutional validation before reaching users, ensuring compliance with community-defined rules.

**Integration Architecture**:
- API wrappers for OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models
- Streaming validation (check output as it's generated)
- Constitutional feedback loop to guide model responses
- Target: 95% of LLM outputs pass constitutional validation

### Phase 11: Frontend Dashboard Development
**Effort Estimate**: 8-10 implementation sessions

Building a Next.js dashboard for system visualization and monitoring. This provides real-time visibility into document processing, constitutional decisions, and system performance.

**Dashboard Components**:
- Pipeline status visualization
- Constitutional decision stream with explanations
- Knowledge graph explorer
- Performance metrics display
- Evidence collection interface

### Phase 12: Production Hardening
**Effort Estimate**: 10-15 implementation sessions

Current implementation is functional but not production-ready. This phase adds robustness for real-world deployment at scale.

**Hardening Tasks**:
- Connection pooling for databases
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Circuit breakers for service failures
- Comprehensive error handling
- Load balancing for constitutional engine

### Phase 13: Community Governance Features
**Effort Estimate**: Ongoing development

Enabling communities to participate in constitutional rule development and management.

**Governance Components**:
- Rule proposal and versioning system
- Impact analysis for rule changes
- Voting mechanisms for rule adoption
- Template library for common rules
- Discussion forums for rule development

## Implementation Session Methodology

Each implementation session represents 4-6 hours of focused development where we can typically accomplish:

- **Bug Fixes**: 10-16 small fixes per session
- **Feature Development**: 1-2 medium features per session
- **Architecture Work**: 1 major design decision per session
- **Documentation**: 5-10 documents updated per session

The key discipline is merging to main at the end of each session, keeping the repository always in a deployable state. This prevents the "integration hell" that can occur with long-lived branches.

## Evidence and Validation

All phase completions are validated through:

1. **Working Code**: Implementations in `apps/` directory
2. **Test Coverage**: Tests in `tests/` with coverage reports
3. **Performance Data**: Receipts in `var/receipts/phase*/`
4. **Git History**: Commits showing development progression
5. **CI Status**: GitHub Actions showing passing checks

For example, the constitutional engine's 0.000173ms overhead claim is validated by:
- Implementation: `apps/constitution_engine/engine.py`
- Tests: `tests/performance/test_decision_overhead_and_footprint.py`
- Evidence: `var/receipts/phase6c/validation/constitutional_overhead.json`
- Verification: TLA+ specs in `verification/tla/` with 45,217 states explored

## Resource Planning

Given single-developer constraints, effort must be carefully prioritized:

**Immediate (Do Yourself)**:
1. Grant application materials - enables funding
2. Evidence package assembly - proves system works
3. Architecture decisions - long-term impact
4. Open-DARF cleanup - public credibility

**Delegatable (Agents Can Help)**:
1. Test coverage improvements - mechanical work
2. Documentation formatting - follows templates
3. Dependency updates - routine maintenance
4. Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps

**Defer Until Funded**:
1. Microservice decomposition - premature optimization
2. Kubernetes deployment - unnecessary complexity
3. Multi-tenant features - no users yet
4. Advanced monitoring - basic logging sufficient

## Critical Path to Grant Success

The October 1 grant deadline drives all priorities:

```
NOW → Evidence Package → Open-DARF Cleanup → Video Demo → Grant Submission
 ↓                                                              ↓
Fix Agent Issues                                          October 1
 ↓                                                              ↓
Establish Boundaries                                      Funding Decision
 ↓                                                              ↓
Resume Development                                    Scale with Resources
```

Everything else can wait until after grant submission. The system works - now we need to prove it works in a way that secures funding for continued development.
