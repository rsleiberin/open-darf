Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-09-29 14:30:03.
Progress(4) at 2025-09-29 14:30:06: 1,662,487 states generated (1,662,487 s/min), 97,781 distinct states found (97,781 ds/min), 80,971 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 5.0E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 2.9E-9
9612789 states generated, 97781 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 4.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 31 and the 95th percentile is 0).
