Finished computing initial states: 16 distinct states generated at 2025-09-29 14:41:36.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 7.6E-17
81 states generated, 25 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 3.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 0 (minimum is 0, the maximum 1 and the 95th percentile is 1).
