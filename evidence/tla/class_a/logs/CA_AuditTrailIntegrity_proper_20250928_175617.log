Error: TLC threw an unexpected exception.
This was probably caused by an error in the spec or model.
See the User Output or TLC Console for clues to what happened.
The exception was a java.lang.RuntimeException
: Attempted to enumerate a set of the form [l1 : v1, ..., ln : vn],
but can't enumerate the value of the `ts' field:
Nat
Error: The behavior up to this point is:
State 1: <Initial predicate>
Log = <<>>

Error: The error occurred when TLC was evaluating the nested
expressions at the following positions:
0. Line 24, column 6 to line 28, column 38 in CA_AuditTrailIntegrity
