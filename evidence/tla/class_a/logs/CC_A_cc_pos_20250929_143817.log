Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-09-29 14:38:17.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 4.5E-13
14425 states generated, 601 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 3.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 24 and the 95th percentile is 0).
