Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-09-28 23:00:44.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 4.5E-16
193 states generated, 64 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 7.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 6 and the 95th percentile is 3).
