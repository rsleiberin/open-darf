Finished computing initial states: 64 distinct states generated at 2025-09-29 19:04:50.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.2E-16
128 states generated, 64 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 1.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 0 (minimum is 0, the maximum 0 and the 95th percentile is 0).
