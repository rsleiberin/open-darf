# Open-DARF: Constitutional AI Validation System

Open-DARF demonstrates mathematical governance of AI systems through constitutional constraints, achieving sub-millisecond oversight validation while preserving democratic legitimacy.

## Academic Significance

This system provides empirical evidence that AI governance can be implemented through formal mathematical constraints rather than training-based approaches, supporting constitutional AI research and democratic AI governance frameworks.

## Quick Validation

~~~bash
./install    # Setup Docker services
./validate   # Run constitutional validation
./cleanup    # Remove all traces
~~~

## System Requirements

- Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) or Docker + Compose (Linux)
- 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended
- 10GB available disk space

## Generated Evidence

Validation produces cryptographically-signed evidence packages suitable for academic review, grant applications, and peer verification.
