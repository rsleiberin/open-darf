# Safety Vulnerability Remediation

## Issue
Pre-commit safety check is failing due to vulnerabilities in indirect dependencies:

1. **setuptools 75.3.2** - CVE-2025-47273 (Path Traversal)
2. **urllib3 2.2.3** - CVE-2025-50181, CVE-2025-50182 (Redirect vulnerabilities)

## Impact
- Blocking pre-commit hooks
- Security vulnerabilities in development dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Update safety configuration to ignore false positives if needed
2. Update pre-commit hooks to newer versions
3. Consider alternative safety scanning approaches
4. Document security scanning workflow
