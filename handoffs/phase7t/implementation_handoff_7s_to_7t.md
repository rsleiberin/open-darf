# Phase 7T — Implementation Handoff (7S ➜ 7T)
(7S ➜ 7T critical context digest)
- 7S delivered CPU validation + evidence bundles + acceptance gates and a tagged kit.
- 7T must layer provenance anchoring without breaking 7S flows.
- Interfaces to preserve: make targets, tarball layout, receipt keys; add 'provenance' namespace.
- Risks: newline/locale drift; WSL vs native differences; time constraints; avoid scope-creep.
