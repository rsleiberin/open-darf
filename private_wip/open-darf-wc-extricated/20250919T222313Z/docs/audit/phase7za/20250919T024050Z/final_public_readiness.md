# Open-DARF (scoped to `open-darf-wc`) â€” Final Public Readiness @ 20250919T024050Z

## State
- Header previews ready to apply: **31** files
- Fence normalization needed: **0** files (0 means already compliant) 
- Guard results on current tree:
  - doc fences rc: 0  (0 => compliant)  log: open-darf-wc/docs/audit/phase7za/20250919T024050Z/guard_doc_fences.out
  - header presence rc: 0  (expected non-zero until headers are applied)  log: open-darf-wc/docs/audit/phase7za/20250919T024050Z/guard_comment_headers.out

## Zero-Risk Next Step (on Architect ALLOW)
1) Apply headers using preview mirror:
   `bash open-darf-wc/tools/apply_headers.sh open-darf-wc/_header_applied_preview header_apply_list.tsv`
2) Re-run local guards in `open-darf-wc/scripts/ci/` and confirm rc=0 for both.
3) Commit with receipts references and open PR:
   *chore(open-darf-wc): add standard headers (7ZA)*
