## Constitutional Engine — Fail-Closed Posture (Phase-2)

- **Default (prod)**: fail-closed — when the graph/DB is unavailable or schema is missing, decisions surface as `INDETERMINATE` with a reason slug.
- **Dev-only override**: set `ENGINE_FAIL_OPEN=true` locally to flip `_fail_closed_default()` to ALLOW (used for rapid local testing).
- **API contract**: responses include `{ decision: ALLOW|DENY|INDETERMINATE, reason_code: <slug> }`.
