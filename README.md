# Darf Intelligence Stack

**A perfect day is completing each moment of that day perfectly.**

A constitutional AI platform that operates as your digital self‚Äîmaking decisions within formal constraints, managing budgets autonomously, and maintaining perfect memory of every choice through a structured Architecture Decision Record (ADR) system.

---

## Philosophy

This system embodies **digital sovereignty**: an AI agent that represents you with the same intentionality you bring to each decision, operating within the constitutional bounds you define, with full audit trails and fraud-detection capabilities.

---

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

The system's intelligence comes from its decision architecture‚Äîevery capability, integration, and constraint is formally documented in ADRs that create an executable knowledge graph:

- **25+ interconnected ADRs** with full research traceability
- **Research ‚Üí Concept ‚Üí Implementation** chain for all technical decisions
- **Constitutional framework** for agent behaviour and budget constraints
- **Self-documenting evolution** as capabilities expand

Browse the corpus in `docs/decisions/`.

## Core Capabilities

### Decision Architecture
* Formal reasoning through structured ADR workflows
* Evidence-based decisions with research traceability
* Confidence scoring and uncertainty acknowledgement
* Constitutional constraints preventing unauthorised actions

### Agent Operations
* Budget management with crypto-wallet integration
* Authentication gating for major decisions (phone / biometric)
* Perfect memory of all decisions and their rationale
* Fraud detection via behavioural-pattern analysis

---

## Local Containers (Podman)

We run local services (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Qdrant, etc.) with **Podman**.
Follow the instructions in `infra/podman/README_podman.md` to install Podman 3.4+ on Ubuntu 20.04 and start the compose file.

```bash
# example (once Podman is installed and compose file filled in)
cd infra/podman
podman-compose up -d   # start databases
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rsleiberin/darf-source.git
cd darf-source

# install Python deps
poetry install --no-interaction

# lint & test
make lint test

# run backend (draft)
python apps/backend/main.py
```

*Empowering individuals with sovereign, auditable AI‚Äîone perfectly-documented decision at a time.*

**Notes**

* The stack table lists Podman **3.4+** because that‚Äôs what installs cleanly on Ubuntu 20.04; you can bump the version when you upgrade the OS or move to Snap builds.
* The ‚ÄúLocal Containers (Podman)‚Äù section points contributors to `infra/podman/` for compose files and install docs‚Äîaligning with your new branch.

Commit this updated README on `infra-podman-init` (or a fresh branch) before opening the PR.

## RAG Foundation Sprint Overview

During the RAG Foundation sprint, the team completed a series of improvements to both the backend and developer environment:

- Refactored `apps/backend/main.py` to remove inline class fields and one‚Äëline function bodies, satisfying Ruff‚Äôs E701/E702 lint rules.
- Migrated to the new `langchain_community` packages and replaced deprecated `Qdrant` and `OpenAIEmbeddings` imports with `QdrantClient` and their community equivalents.
- Expanded `rag_query` with robust exception handling and return type annotations.
- Installed missing dependencies (`langchain-community`, `qdrant-client`, `tiktoken`, `psycopg2-binary`) and updated the lockfile to reflect these.
- Added CI-friendly behavior for the PostgreSQL connection test by skipping it when the `CI` environment variable is set.
- Added a `.env.example` file and updated `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules/` and `.turbo/` directories.
- Removed Podman-specific artefacts and updated container documentation for Qdrant and Neo4j services.
- Ensured that all tests pass (`pytest`), type checks succeed (`mypy`), and lint issues are resolved (`ruff`) before merging.
